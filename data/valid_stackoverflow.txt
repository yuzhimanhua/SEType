In

operator

As
everyone
already
stated
,
the
+
=
has
an
implicit
cast
.

To
help
illustrate
that
,
I
'm
going
to
use
an

I
wrote
a

back
that
is
perfect

these
types

It
's
an

so
you
can
check
out
the
actual

that
's
being
produced
:
http://javabytes.herokuapp.com/

And
a
table
of
their
meanings
:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode_instruction_listings

So
let
's
take
a
look
at
the
bytecode
from
some
simple
Java

:

First
,
construct
pattern
string
of
state
names

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6575

Then
,
use
stringr::str_extract_all

stringr::str_extract
to
extract

from
string
and
add
new
column
to
data
frame
.

CODE_BLOCK

Then
merge

The

here
is
that
when

it
will
render

thus
why
I
constrain
it
so
.

coding
of

temporary

The

uniform
them

;
each

represents
one

.

Thus
the
hard

matrix
value
in

should
highlight
the
left

of
the
bottom

.

I

I
assume
you
are
using
the
FormData
object
,
in
that
case
you
need
to
append
the
string
values
to
the
FormData
object
,
and
pass
the
object
in
as
the
data
parameter
in
jQuery
's
$

.

You
can
append
data
to
the
FormData
object
,
with
the
method
append
.

This

Breeze
metadata
is
information
about
all
the
objects
you
have
to
work
with
.

You
can
fetch
metadata
from
server-side
or
you
can
create
metadata
by
yourself
and
work
with
it
.

If
you
want
to
work
with
your
server-side
objects
in
breeze
you
create
an
entity
manager
with
var
entityManager
=
new
breeze.EntityManager('api/Db')
;
where
api/db
is
your
asp.net
controller
.

This
controller
should
have
a
Metadata()
method
which
returns
repository.Metadata()
.

In
js
you
call
entityManager.fetchMetadata()
.then(success,failed)
;
After
the
promise
of
fetchMetadata()
is
resolved
,
breeze
metadata
of
variable
entityManager
is
full-filled
and
you
can
start
working
with
your
server-side
objects
in
js
with
breeze
!

But
you
can
also
work
without
any
metadata
from
server-side
and
create
it
on
the
fly
in
your
js
code
.

You
create
your
own
metadataStore
,
attach
it
to
entitymanager
.

That
depends
on
what
you
do
.

The
rules
are
simple
:
when
you
read
it
again
by
using
a
FileInputStream
or
a
FileReader
,
you
will
always
get
the
latest
content
.

The
OS
might
optimize
this
in
memory
,
if
the
file
is
not
edited
.

If
you
simply
keep
the
file
contents
into
a
self
constructed
buffer
(
e.g
.
:
a
String
or
a
byte[]
)
,
and
the
file
changes
,
of
course
the
buffer
will
remained
unchanged
.

So
I
am
fairly
new
to
iOS
development
and
have
decide
to
create
a
project
of
my
own
.

This
app
is
using
Parse
as
it
's
backend
.

I
know
that
it
is
better
to
have
all
the
database
calls
in
one
class
,
but
am
unsure
of
the
best
way
to
do
it
.

So
far
I
have
two
options
:

Create
separate
.h
and
.m
files
and
put
all
database
accessors
there
as
static
methods

Create
base
.h
and
.m
files
(
that
inherit
from
UIViewController
)
and
put
all
the
calls
there
.

Then
derive
all
my
other
view
controllers
in
the
app
from
this
one
.

Which
of
these
two
options
is
better
?

Or
is
there
a
better
way
to
do
this
than
these
two
options
?

While
this
is
purely
opinion
based
I
would
argue
for
solution
1
.

This
creates
a
good
separation
of
code
and
makes
it
clear
where
the
database
methods
are
located
both
when
looking
at
a
view
controller
.

Compare
[
DBConnector
performDatabaseMethod
]
to
[
self
performDatabaseMethod
]
the
second
one
seems
weird
and
out
of
place
if
self
is
a
UIViewController
subclass
.

Another
option
is
using
a
singleton
database
accessor
which
you
access
using
[
[
DBConnector
sharedInstance
]
performMethod
]
where
sharedInstance
looks
something
like
this

analises

nothing

I
do
n't
know
about
other
frameworks
,
but
with
Dojo
Toolkit
you
can
take
advantage
of
caching
better
by
using
a
public
CDN
copy
of
the
source
in
your
site
,
from
AOL
or
Google
.

If
the
JavaScript
code
of
the
framework
is
served
as
a
cacheable
file
then
the
download
cost
of
requesting
the
entire
framework
(
e.g
.
jQuery.js
)
can
be
eliminated
,
but
if
you
were
generating
the
framework
code
on
the
fly
(
as
you
suggest
above
)
then
it
's
going
to
be
harder
to
take
advantage
of
caching
.

On
top
of
this
the
memory
cost
of
defining
the
entire
framework
is
probably
unlikely
to
be
problematic
(
assuming
the
framework
is
written
sensibly
)
.

So
,
pulling
in
the
entire
framework
,
as
is
the
common
case
,
is
simple
,
works
well
and
does
n't
require
a
particular
server-side
infrastructure
(
like
GWT
does
)
.

Lets
take
a
closer
look
at
your
output
operator
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5991
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

It
's
called
when
you
output
a
std::vector<char>
.

It
will
then
output
a
std::vector<char>
which
causes
a
recursive
call
,
and
so
on
in
infinity
(
or
until
you
get
a
stack
overflow
)
.

What
your
output
operator
needs
to
to
is
iterate
over
the
vector
and
output
each
element
.

On
an
unrelated
note
,
do
n't
pass
the
vector
by
value
to
the
function
.

Instead
use
a
constant
reference

I
have
a

[
TCP

the

about

do
the

receives

send
a

image

the
application
should
do
the
3
tasks
in

After
i
done
that
and
it
worked
.
.
i
realized
that
these
kind
of

should
use
one

for
all
tasks
.
.
like
Radmin
and
netsupport
.
.
etc

but
i
used
3
ports

.
one
to
keep
receiving
commands
any
time
the
client
sends
.

and
one
for
receiving

.
.
and
one
if
the

asked
for
a

so
is
it
fine
to
use
3
ports
for

I
've

to
create
3

the

received

so
it

i
ca
n't
use

so
is
it

use

Yes
,
it
is
wise
to
use
multiple
ports
when
doing
file
transfers
.

It
would
require
a
quite
advanced
protocol
to
use
the
same
port
and
still
keep
the
application
response
(
as
you
still
have
to
be
able
to
send
commands
during
file
transfers
)
.

But
I
do
not
recommend
you
to
use
three
fixed
ports
.

Use
one
port
for
all
commands
and
an
arbitrary
number
of
ports
for
the
file
transfers
.

A
file
transfer
would
look
like
this
:

(
CmdPort
)
Client
->
Server
Hey
I
want
to
transfer
file
XXX
with
size
YYYY

(
CmdPort
)
Server
->
Client
Roger
,
connect
to
port
8217
and
transfer
the
file

(
8217
)
Client
->
Server
Connects
,
transfer
the
entire
file
,
disconnect

(
8217
)
Server
Checks
that
the
transferred
size
matches
the
one
specified
in
step
#1

That
allows
you
to
transfer
several
files
at
the
same
time
.

Let
the
server
create
a
new
listening
socket
using
port
0
.

It
tells
the
OS
to
select
a
free
port
.

Then
use
Socket.LocalEndpoint
to
find
out
the
port
before
sending
it
back
in
step
#2
.

The
specified
approach
also
lets
you
take
advantage
of
Socket.SendFile
which
is
probably
the
most
effective
and
fastest
way
to
send
files
using
.NET
.

(
FTP
uses
the
same
approach
,
as
do
bittorrent
.

You
might
have
used
a
file
manager
when
downloading
files
from
the
web
.

They
takes
a
more
extreme
approach
and
splits
up
the
file
download
over
multiple
sockets
to
get
around
web
server
bandwidth
throttling
.
)

update
in
response
to
a
comment
:

OP_BLOCK
:
(
output
omitted
for
annotation
)

You
did
not
specify
that
information
in
the
original
question
,
which
made
me
assume
that
you
only
transfer
one
file
at
a
time
.

Batch
transfers
would
work
in
the
same
way
,
just
change
so
that
step
#1
sends
a
list
of
filename+size
and
then
send
all
files
after
each
other
in
step
#3
.

It
would
not
be
best
practice
to
use
3
ports
unless
each
operation
was
it
's
own
application
,
i.e
.
a
file
server
,
an
image
server
etc
.

You
should
create
one
application
listening
on
1
port
and
then
use
Threading
to
accept
multiple
connections
to
the
server
(
each
with
it
's
own
instance
of
a
StreamReader
)
.

You
could
then
write
a
parser
method
for
the
users
input
.

For
example
,
if
the
user
sends
the
command
"
RECIEVE
FILE
"
,
the
server
would
expect
a
File
,
if
the
user
sent
the
command
"
IMAGE
"
the
server
would
expect
an
image
.

Found
this
about
an
hour
after
posting
this
question
.

Maybe
two
.

Apparently
report_times
is
part
of
debugging
symbols
(?)

for
GCC
.

To
exclude
report_times
(
which
causes
the
'
failed
to
get
process
times
'
from
the
original
question
)
you
have
to
build
the
debug
...
or
release
...
version
of
gcc
.

To
do
this
,
I
used
info
from
this
link
:
http://www-gpsg.mit.edu/~simon/gcc_g77_install/build.html

BUT
,
I
omitted
the
-g
from
the
LIBCXXFLAGS
and
LIBCFLAGS
and
I
added
LIBCPPFLAGS
without
-g
just
in
case
.

Ran
make
DESTDIR
=
/staging/install/path
install-host
,
tarballed
and
transferred
to
device
.

No
more
'
failed

error

am
seeing
another

it
is
not

I
would
n't
use
the
onclick
method
here
.

I
would
use
jQuery
to
assign
the
events
to
your
list
items
.

But
if
you
must
,
in
your
onclick
method
,
try
passing
this.value
like
so
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5426
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Then
your
fill()
method
could
be
something
like
so
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5427
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

EDIT
:
You
are
mixing
plain
JavaScript
and
jQuery
code
.

I
replaced
your
plain
JS
line
with
the
jQuery
equivalent
.

Also
,
if
you
are
adding
the
fill()
method
in
the
same
loop
that
adds
the
LIs
,
then
you
are
adding
multiple
fill
methods
,
which
is
incorrect
.

Just
add
it
once
in
the
same
script
tag
like
below

I

this
in
Valgrind
.

CODE_BLOCK

Q_518
(
code

Is
it
any
concern
?

Answer_to_Question_ID
:
6803986

Question_URL
:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6803986/

A
big
part
of
Valgrind
's
magic
is
how
it
is
able
to
intercept/redirect
function
calls
in
order
to
keep
track
of
the
state
of
the
world
.

As
I
understand
it
,
redirection
is
achieved
using
shared
object/function
name
patterns
which
when
matched
'
redirect
'
calls
to
new
addresses
.

Checking
out
the
valgrind
source
,
we
find
the
notion
of
a
'
redirector
'
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_790
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

(
m_redir.c
line
10
4)

So
'
Specs
'
provide
shared
object/function
name
to
address
mappings
and
'
Actives
'
represent
the
mappings
themselves
.

Active
computation
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_791
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

(
m_redir.c
line
120
)

The
idea
of
"
conflicting
redirections
"
is
mentioned
here
too
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_792
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

(
m_redir.c
line
15
2)

And
for
interests
sake
,
here
is
where
your
warning
is
generated
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_793
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

(
m_redir.c
line
66
4)

So
,
after
all
this
it
is
probably
safe
to
assume
that
:

The
redirection
messages
are
part
of
normal
valgrind
operation
.

The
warning
message
is
likely
a
result
of
conflicting
spec
patterns
(
probably
not
a
great
cause
for
concern
in
this
instance
.
)

there

no

Specifying

its

It

There

.

You
could
fake
your

that
it

you

Using

First

you

Scala

Apache
project
documentation
tends
to
be
terrible
about
explaining
how
to
get
started
.

For
example
,
you
'll
see
"
Download
"
links
everywhere
that
show
you
how
to
get
the
project
code
and
jars
.

Do
n't
do
this
!

Use
a
proper
build
system
that
will
manage
your
dependencies
for
you
.

For
this
example
I
'll
use
SBT
,
but
Maven
would
work
just
as
well
(
although
with
a
lot
more
verbosity
)
.

Once
you
've
got
SBT
installed
you
can
search
Maven
Central
for
"
commons-math
"
,
which
will
take
you
here
.

You
'll
see
a
"
Scala
SBT
"
button
on
the
side
;
click
it
and
copy
the
text
to
a
file
called
build.sbt
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3527
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Okay
,
now
you
can
start
an
SBT
console
with
sbt
console
.

Now
you
need
to
know
the
full
path
to
the
class
you
want
,
which
of
course
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
Apache
documentation
,
because
that
would
be
too
convenient
.

With
a
little
bit
of
Googling
you
'll
find
the
following
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3528
(
code
omitted
for

)

And
now
you
can
create
an
instance
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3529
(
code

And
you
're
done
!

Now

Please
consider
this
(
non-homework
)
exercise
of
converting
a
slash-notation
(
e.g
.
24
,
30
)
to
a
subnet
mask
.

When
I
copy
a
BitArray
to
byte[]
,
the
internal
ordering
of
the
BitArray
leads
to
incorrect
output
.

For
instance
,
with
an
input
of
numberOfSetBits
=
24
,
ToString()
should
return
255.255.255.0
(
this
works
because
the
bits
are
symmetrical
)
.

However
,
an
input
of
30
results
in
255.255.255.63
instead
of
the
expected
255.255.255.252
.

Yes
,
I
realize
that
that
's
just
the
way
a
BitArray
handles
it
's
children
(
there
's
an
old
discussion
about
the
issue
,
unfortunately
without
a
solution
,
just
a
never-ending
argument
over
why
one
ordering
would
be
better
)
.

But
how
,
for
the
love
of
god
,
can
I
get
this
code
to
treat
1111
1100
(=
25
2)
for
what
it
is
instead
of
mangling
it
to
0011
1111
(=
6
3)
?

I
believe
I
'll
have
to
change
the
order
in
which
I
'm
adding
the
bits
in
the
first
place
,
but
I
ca
n't
get
it
to
work
.

You
do
n't
need
a
BitArray
,
you
can
create
the
mask
from
shifting
an
integer
,
and
use
BitConverter.GetBytes
to
get
it
as
bytes

Would
n't
this
just
be
fixed
by
doing
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_1358
(
code

This
sets
the
high-order
bits
(
rather
than
the
low-order
bits
)
.

The
reasoning
here
is
precisely
what
is
mentioned
in
the
answer
you
linked
-
BitArray
stores
the
least-significant
digits
in
the
lowest
index
,
so
the
bit
array
11111000000000
below
is
[

When
the
LayoutTranform

When
it
is

the
translation
does
not
appear

to
be
applied

and
the
test
Canvas
is
still
located

When
it
is
set
to
a
MatrixTransform
that
has
been
constructed

only

letterlist

Therefore
,
you
ca

A
function
can
reference
itself
only
because
the

is
not
called
until
after

but
a
list
comprehension
is
being
executed

so
it

A

then
remove

Using

That

The

command-line
switches
(
such
as
-Xmx256m
)
.

Just
add
it
to
the
Command

Options
to
the
Run
Configuration
(
you
could
create
2
configurations
,
one
for
each
setting
)
.

To
be
more
specific
:

Go
to
your
application
's
main
class

Run
it

This
should
create
a
Run
(
or
Launch

Configuration

Edit
this
configuration

Add
-client

in
the

Attempting
to
do
this
at
the
JSF
application
layer
is
unlikely
to
be
successful
;
I
would
perform
this
task
at
a
lower
level
API
.

I
am
assuming
a
servlet
container
.

I
can
think
of
two
approaches
:

do
this
at
a
container
level
via
a
server-specific
SPI
(
if
one
even
exists
)

do
this
by
rewriting
requests/responses
via
a
servlet
Filter

There
is
insufficient
information
to
comment
on
the
viability
of
the
first
approach
.

In
the
second
,
you
would
have
to
determine
the
name
of
the
session
cookie
(
it
is
usually
JSESSIONID
,
but
does
not
have
to
be
)
.

Your
API
would
:

map
the
filter
to
all
application
requests

maintain
a
map
of
container
session
ids
to
"
secure
"
ids

use
the
filter
to
rewrite
any
session
cookie
in
the
request
with
the
session
id

use
the
filter
rewrite
any
session
cookie
in
the
response
with
the
secure
id

use
a
listener
to
remove
invalid
sessions
from
the
map
to
avoid
memory
leaks

Answer_to_Question_ID

Question_URL

I
really
doubt
you
'll
generate
session
IDs
that
are
more
secure
than
the
ones
generated
by
the
container
,
but
here
's
what
you
could
do
,
without
using
any
container-specific
extension
.

Create
a
servlet
filter
which
intercept
every
request
to
the
server
.

When
a
request
comes
in
,
check
if
a
session
already
exists
for
this
request
(
using
getSession(false))
.

If
one
exists
,
then
extract
your
specific
cookie
MY_SESSION_ID
from
the
request
,
and
compare
its
value
to
the
one
that
is
stored
in
the
session
.

If
they
do
n't
match
,
reject
the
request
.

If
the
session
does
n't
exist
,
then
create
it
(
using
getSession(true))
,
generate
your
super-secure
session
ID
,
store
it
as
a
session
attribute
and
add
the
cookie
MY_SESSION_ID
to
the
response
.

This
has
the
disadvantage
of
creating
a
session
automatically
,
even
if
it
's
not
strictly
needed
.

But
that
's
the
case
most
of
the
time
when
using
JSPs
of
component
frameworks
.

AFAIK
,
the
default
language
is
decided
at
start-up
,
as
you
experienced
.

This
allows
to
override
the
default
language
using
some
command
line
arguments
.

I
'm
afraid
,
this
is
how
it
is
.

You
will
have
to
restart
the
application
to
get
the
changed
default
language
from
the
OS
.

3
hours
for
users
who
have
not

I

start
counting
once
they
register

and
when
they

the

will
be
displayed
on

Please

with
a
simple

to
implement
this
?

You
can
store
timestamp
in
a
field
of
user
table
when
registering
new
user
.

also
you
can
use
mysql
insert
trigger
to
do
that
automatically
for
you
.

when
user
logged
in
,
you
can
subtract
registered
timestamp
from
current
timestam
and
show
in
user
dashboard
.

also
you
can
use
JavaScript
to
continues
showing
counting
down
timer
in
in
user
dashboard
with
interval
or
setTimeout
.

Edited
:

to
set
timestamp
in
you
table
you
can
simply
Default
value
to
your
field
,
something
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6150
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

OP_BLOCK
:
(
output
omitted
for
annotation
)

when
your
try
to
login
or
when
your
Job
fired
,
you
can
check
time
and
delete
user
if
time
is
more
than
3
hours
an
user
do
n't
finish
registration
steps
.

something
like
below

:

I
'm
working
on
an
automatic
summarization
system
in
my
C++
class
and
have
a
question
regarding
one
of
the
ASCII
comparisons
I
'm
doing
.

Here
's
the
code
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_816
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

What
is
being
done
here
(
with
the
two
if
statements
)
is
checking
whether
a
new
sentence
has
begun
in
the
text
that
is
to
be
analyzed
and
dealt
with
later
.

The
conditionals
work
but
only
because
we
discovered
that
we
have
to
check
for
that
-1
as
well
.

Any
ideas
what
that
represents
?

Answer_to_Question_ID

9517451

Question_URL

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9517451/

As
an
ASCII
character
-1
does
n't
represent
anything
(
which
is
to
say
-1
is
not
a
valid
ASCII
value
)
.

As
the
return
value
from
get()
it
means
that
the
read
operation
failed
-
most
likely
due
to
the
end
of
file
being
reached
.

Note
that
the
eof()
function
does
n't
return
true
if
the
next
call
to
get
will
fail
because
of
the
end
of
file
being
reached
-
it
returns
true
if
the
previous
call
to
get
failed
because
of
the
end
of
file
being
reached
.

Answer_to_Question_ID

Question_URL

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9517451/

The
fact
that
checking
for
-1
works
is
an
accident
,
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
ASCII
values
(
which
only
use
0
to
127
)
.

Your
code
will
fail
if
either
plain
char
is
unsigned
(
compile
with
/J
with
VC++
,
I
think
)
,
or
EOF
is
n't
-1
(
rare
,
but
all
that
's
guaranteed
is
that
it
is
negative
)
.

You
're
code
will
also
fail
if
the
input
happens
to
be
Latin-1
,
and
it
contains
a
'
ÿ
'
.

The
basic
problem
in
your
code
is
that
you
're
not
checking
for
end
of
file
correctly
.

Putting
the
test
at
the
top
of
the
loop
does
n't
work
;
you
need
to
test
for
failure
(
not
eof())
after
input
,
before
using
the
value
read
.

There
are
several
ways
of
doing
this
;
in
your
case
,
the
simplest
is
probably
to
use
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_1193
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Alternatively
,
you
can
make
ch
an
int
,
and
do
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_1194
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
has
the
advantage
that
the
following
call
to
tolower
is
no
longer
undefined
behavior
(
tolower
takes
an
int
,
which
must
be
in
the
range
0
...
UCHAR_MAX
or
EOF
—
if
plain
char
is
signed
,
you
are
n't
guaranteeing
this
)
.

On
the
other
hand
,
it
does
n't
allow
chaining
,
i.e
.
you
ca
n't
write
the
equivalent
of
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_1195
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

(
which
could
be
useful
in
some
cases
)
.

FWIW
:
the
technique
you
're
using
is
something
called
a
sliding
window
into
a
stream
,
and
it
's
worth
pushing
it
off
into
a
separate
class
to
handle
the
logic
of
keeping
the
window
filled
and
up
to
date
.

Alternatively
,
a
simple
state
machine
could
be
used
for
your
problem
.

And
I
'd
definitely
avoid
using
magic
constants
:
if
you
want
to
check
for
a
carriage
return
,
compare
with
'
\r
'
.

Similarly
,
newline
is
'
\n
'
,
and
in
the
outer
if
,
it
looks
like
you
want
to
check
for
whitespace
(
isspace
(
static_cast
<unsigned
char>
(
sentenceCheck.second
)
)
)
,
rather
than
comparing
for
the
values
.

I
might
also
add
that
your
code
fails
to
correctly
handle
sentences
that
end
with
a
quote
,
like
This
is
the
"
text
in
your
input
.
"
;
it
also
fails
for
abbreviations
like
Mr
.
Jones
is
here.
.

But
those
problems
may
be
beyond
the
scope
of
your
assignment
.

(
The
abbreviations
one
is
probably
not
fully
solvable
:
sometimes
"
etc
.
"
is
the
end
of
a
sentence
,
and
sometimes
it
's
not
.

To
figure
out
what
's
wrong
,
you
need
to
actually
see
the
exception
.

Just
double-clicking
the
jar
file
will
launch
it
using
"
javaw.exe
"
,
which
has
no
console
and
therefore
only
reports
that
there
was
an
exception
-
-
without
the
stack
trace
.

Instead
,
start
a
command
prompt
and
"
cd
"
to
where
your
jar
file
is
.

Then
,
supposing
that
the
jar
name
is
"
MyJarFile.jar
"
,
run
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2381
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

When
run
with
"
java.exe
"
,
your
printStackTrace()
will
actually
have
a
console
in
which
to
print
the
stack
trace
,
which
will
point
you
to
the
offending
line
of
code
and
state
the
type
of
problem
.

UPDATE
(
following
the
posted
exception
)
:

Ah
,
since
you
require
a
third
party
dependency
,
you
need
to
switch
to
something
like
this
,
running
your
main
class
explicitly
and
specifying
a
classpath
containing
all
required
classes
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2382
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

with
...
"
path
\to
"
,
"
ApachePoiJarName
"
,
"
MyAppJarFile
"
,
"
my.main.class.package
"
and
"
MyMainClass
"
replaced
with
the
appropriate
name
.

If
the
POI
jar
requires
in
turn
its
own
dependencies
,
add
the
paths
to
those
files
to
the
class
path
as
well
(
a
list
of
jar
paths
separated
by
semicolons
,
no
spaces
between
them
)

I
'm
looking
for
some
way
to
effectively
hide
inherited
members
.

I
have
a
library
of
classes
which
inherit
from
common
base
classes
.

Some
of
the
more
recent
descendant
classes
inherit
dependency
properties
which
have
become
vestigial
and
can
be
a
little
confusing
when
using
IntelliSense
or
using
the
classes
in
a
visual
designer
.

These
classes
are
all
controls
that
are
written
to
be
compiled
for
either
WPF
or
Silverlight
2.0
.

I
know
about
ICustomTypeDescriptor
and
ICustomPropertyProvider
,
but
I
'm
pretty
certain
those
ca
n't
be
used
in
Silverlight
.

It
's
not
as
much
a
functional
issue
as
a
usability
issue
.

What
should
I
do
?

Update

Some
of
the
properties
that
I
would
really
like
to
hide
come
from
ancestors
that
are
not
my
own
and
because
of
a
specific
tool
I
'm
designing
for
,
I
ca
n't
do
member
hiding
with
the
new
operator
.

(
I
know
,
it
's
ridiculous

I
think
you
're
best
least
hackish
way
is
to
consider
composition
as
opposed
to
inheritance
.

Or
,
you
could
create
an
interface
that
has
the
members
you
want
,
have
your
derived
class
implement
that
interface
,
and
program
against
the
interface
.

I
know
there
's
been
several
answers
to
this
,
and
it
's
quite
old
now
,
but
the
simplest
method
to
do
this
is
just
declare
them
as
new
private
.

Consider
an
example
I
am
currently
working
on
,
where
I
have
an
API
that
makes
available
every
method
in
a
3rd
party
DLL
.

I
have
to
take
their
methods
,
but
I
want
to
use
a
.Net
property
,
instead
of
a
"
getThisValue
"
and
"
setThisValue
"
method
.

So
,
I
build
a
second
class
,
inherit
the
first
,
make
a
property
that
uses
the
get
and
set
methods
,
and
then
override
the
original
get
and
set
methods
as
private
.

They
're
still
available
to
anyone
wanting
to
build
something
different
on
them
,
but
if
they
just
want
to
use
the
engine
I
'm
building
,
then
they
'll
be
able
to
use
properties
instead
of
methods
.

Using
the
double
class
method
gets
rid
of
any
restrictions
on
being
unable
to
use
the
new
declaration
to
hide
the
members
.

You
simply
ca
n't
use
override
if
the
members
are
marked
as
virtual
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_463
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Now
valueEnum
is
available
to
both
classes
,
but
only
the
property
is
visible
in
the
APIUsageClass
class
.

The
APIClass
class
is
still
available
for
people
who
want
to
extend
the
original
API
or
use
it
in
a
different
way
,
and
the
APIUsageClass
is
available
for
those
who
want
something
more
simple
.

Ultimately
,
what
I
'll
be
doing
is
making
the
APIClass
internal
,
and
only
expose
my
inherited
class
.

It
would
help
if
the
SQL
statement
was
syntactically
valid
and
if
you
provided
the
exact
error
message
.

When
reformatted
and
syntax
corrected
,
the
statement
looks
like
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_31
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

And
,
when
that
is
run
on
a
system
with
2KB
pages
,
the
error
message
is
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_32
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
standard
way
of
getting
a
brief
explanation
of
an
error
message
is
finderr
;
it
says
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_33
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
'
a
total
of
120
bytes
'
should
be
'
a
total
of
at
least
120
bytes
'
;
that
lower-bound
applies
to
Informix
SE
.

In
IDS
(
Informix
Dynamic
Server
)
,
the
lower-bound
is
255
bytes
,
but
it
is
bigger
in
more
recent
systems
,
and
also
bigger
when
the
page
size
is
bigger
.

You
have
a
variety
of
options
.

You
can
consider
why
your
names
need
to
be
255
characters
each
-
is
that
sensible
(
would
,
say
,
64
be
sufficient
)
?

If
your
server
version
is
recent
enough
(
10.00
or
later
,
I
believe
)
,
you
could
create
the
table
in
a
dbspace
with
a
larger
page
size
.

Since
the
key
is
a
maximum
of
3*255+(20/2+1)
=
776
bytes
,
and
the
rule
of
thumb
is
you
need
to
be
able
to
store
5
maximum-length
key
values
+
ROWID/FRAGID
overhead
(
8
bytes
)
per
page
,
you
would
need
a
4
KB
page
size
.

(
Had
you
been
running
on
AIX
,
you
probably
would
n't
have
noticed
the
issue
.
)

Also
,
you
should
not
be
storing
date
values
in
VARCHAR(255)
;
you
should
use
DATE
or
perhaps
DATETIME
YEAR
TO
DAY
(
a
weird
way
of
spelling
DATE
-
though
the
underlying
format
is
different
,
using
5
bytes
on
disk
instead
of
4
for
a
plain
DATE
)
,
or
perhaps
DATETIME
YEAR
TO
SECOND
(
a
funny
way
of
spelling
TIMESTAMP
)
,
or
..
.

The
'
num0
,
num1
,
num2
'
fields
are
also
dubious
,
too
;
if
they
are
meant
to
store
numbers
,
use
NUMERIC
or
DECIMAL
-
-
DECIMAL(20)
in
most
IDS
databases
means
a
20-digit
floating
point
decimal
number
.

Edited
to
add
:

And
,
to
answer
the
direct
question
,
VARCHAR
columns
can
only
be
up
to
255
bytes
long
;
LVARCHAR
columns
can
be
up
to
about
32
KB
;
CHAR
columns
can
be
up
to
32
KB
;
TEXT
columns
can
be
up
to
2
GB
,
and
CLOB
columns
can
be
even
larger
.

The
total
length
of
a
row
is
limited
to
about
32
KB
(
but
BYTE
,
TEXT
,
BLOB
and
CLOB
columns
count
as
a
fixed
size
descriptor
towards
that
32
KB
total
-
the
actual
data
is
stored
outside
the
row
)
.

There
are
some
version
dependencies
that
I
'm
not
bringing
out
-
if
you
are
using
IDS
10.00
or

I
have
a
free
open
source
app
that
already
supports
multiple
languages
.

To
test
the
languages
I
switch
the
phone
's
setting
|
language
and
everything
works
just
fine
.

Once
in
a
while
I
get
requests
from
people
that
want
to
translate
the
app
to
a
language
that
is
not
listed
on
my
own
device
(
CM
7.1
or
US
Nexus
7
)
.

For
example
,
the
last
one
was
for
Albanian
.

I
presume
that
the
language
code
is
'
sq
'
so
I
can
create
res/values
-sq
with
the
translation
they
provide
but
how
can
I
test
it
on
my
own
phone
?

Is
there
a
way
to
force
my
app
to
use
a
specific
language
code
(
e.g
.
'
sq'
)
,
even
if
it
is
not
listed
in
my
phone
's
settings
?

To
clarify
,
I
do
n't
want
to
reinvent
language
switching
,
just
to
influence
the
resource
selector
to
use
res/values
-sq
.

If
it
matters
,
the
app
uses
android:minSdkVersion
=
"
8
"
.

Your
phone
vendor
chose
not
to
include
the
Albanian
locale
,
so
unfortunately
you
wo
n't
be
able
to
choose
it
.

This
is
usually
vendor
specific
and
depends
greatly
on
your
location
.

For
example
,
Samsung
will
not
include
the
Albanian
locale
in
an
Android
build
used
for
phones
to
be
distributed
in
the
US
.

As
for
forcing
your
app
directly
to
choose
one
of
your
locale
's
,
it
is
not
doable
afaik
.

The
best
you
could
do
(
in
case
you
want
to
test
your
resources
)
would
be
to
recreate
the
project
and
remove
all
the
other
resources
and
leave
the
Albanian-specific
ones
.

The
system
will
"
be
forced
"
use
them
.

specifying

the

do

,
apparently
waypoints
used
"
driving
"
travel

and
I

walking
"
.

As
you

the

Here

the

But
the

I

On

so
I
want
to

how
can
I

Upsettingly
,
Windows
does
not
offer
simple
tools
to
check
whether
port
is
open
on
a
remote
server
.

One
option
is
telnet
but
it
cannot
be
scripted
as
it
closes
when
its
output
is
redirected
or
captured
.

Once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
MSWinsock.Winsock.1
COM
object
installed
on
Windows
machines
that
could
be
used
in
a
script
,
but
no
more
.

PortQry
and
PsPing
are
a
wonderful
tools
but
you
still
have
to
download
them
(
despite
it
being
provided
by
Microsoft
)
.

So
the
easiest
way
is
to
rely
on
PowerShell
.

Here
is
the
code
for
a
simple
.bat
script
,
internally
using
Powershell
to
get
the
job
done
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5951
(

Some
machines
have
.NET
framework
without
PowerShell
installed
so
in
this
case
C#
code
can
be
embedded
into
a
batch
script
using
msbuild
:

CODE_BLOCK

A_5952

As
for

without

I
do
n't
know
any
native
method
to
check
remote

Nothing
is
holding
a
strong
reference
to
your
SelectButton
instance
,
so
as
soon
as
the
function
that
creates
test
exits
,
that
instance
is
released
.

The
button
itself
is
retained
because
you
have
added
it
as
a
subview
.

Therefore
,
it
is
still
visible
but
there
is
no
longer
an
object
to
respond
to
the
action
.

You
either
need
to
use
an
instance
property
rather
than
a
local
variable
for
test
,
or
,
preferably
have
SelectButton
inherit
directly
from

Answer_to_Question_ID

When
someone
taps
the
button
,
usually
you
want
something
to
happen
somewhere
else
in
your
app
(
like
in
one
of
your
view
controllers
or
in
some
other
UI
element
)
.

The
way
the
IBAction
is
set
up
right
now
,
you
have
it
so
that
something
will
trigger
or
happen
within
the
button
itself
when
someone
taps
on
it
.

If
you
want
to
handle
a
button
tap
programmatically
instead
of
ctrl
dragging
from
the
button
into
the
view
controller
,
you
can
do
it
this
way
if
you
prefer
.

First
,
add
this
code
into
the
view
controller
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6485
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Then
you
can
either
add
the
selector
programmatically
by
adding
this
method
into
your
view
controller
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6486
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Or
by
going
to
the
connections
inspector
and
dragging
from
the
touch
up
inside
over
to
the
IBAction
dot
in
your
view
controller
code
.

Also
,
as
someone
else
pointed
out
in
the
comments
you
should
make
your
button
inherit
from
UIButton
by
adding
this
to
your
class
declaration
:

CODE_BLOCK

Now
,
change

Now
,
install

Finally
update

And
at

there

Restart

Boot

Become

or
use

Windows

/mnt

Reinstall
GRUB

This
is
my

question
on
stackoverflow
.

What
I
want
to
do
is
to
create
an
iframe
into
test
div
with
javascript
and
add
html
code
in
it
.

Also
I
want
to
resize
iframe
's
height
dynamically
.

The
code
below
works
good
for
me
only
if
I
set
dynamic_div
's
height
more
than
150px
.

If
the
height
of
the
dynamic_div
less
than
150
it
automatically
sets
iframe
's
height
to
150
.

How
can
I
fix
this
problem
?

P.S
:
html
code
in
the
html
variable
is
dynamic
.

So
I
can
not
change
anything
in
it

Many

I
have
my
Play
Framework
2.1.2
application
and
I
need
to
execute
clean
up
instructions
after
the
user
logs
out
or
closes
the
browser
.

Since
in
my
other
question
I
asked
how
to
intercept
the
closing
action
and
I
was
told
it
's
not
reliable
to
stick
with
javascript
in
browser
,
I
would
like
to
use
its
server
side
session
timeout
event
to
acknowledge
the
user
is
gone
.

So
the
flow
I
would
like
to
obtain
is
similar
to
this
one
:

the
user
logs
in

its
session
is
created

the
user
works
with
my
web
application

the
user
logs
out
/
closes
his
browser
--->
the
session
expires

he
is
not
on
the
platform
anymore
so
I
can
perform
some
operations
on
the
db
about
what
he
has
done

I
coul
n't
find
any
method
to
override
when
the
session
expires
.

Can
someone
point
me
towards
a
solution
?

Eventually
another
acceptable
solution
would
be
some
timed
event
that
repeatedly
checks
which
users
are
not
connected
anymore
and
performs
bulk
operations
on
that
pool
of
users
no

connected
.

How

this
is
the
default
behavior
.

It
's
good
because
you
can
postpone
creation
and
because
the
system
makes
immutable
,
cached
,
reusable
instances
for
you
.

If
you
do
n't
like
that
,
you
can
just
make
a
quick
tool
to
generate
a
data
representation
and
emit
that
to
a
C
file
which
is
compiled
into
your
program
,
then
use
that
as
an
input
to
an
image
creator
call
(
assuming
you
want
an
NSImage
or
CGImage
representation
of
that
)
.

But
that
's
a
bit
extreme
-
perhaps
you
would
favor
removing
the
file
extension
(
or
just
changing
it
to
something
atypical
)
and
then
copying
it
to
the
resources
directory
?

The
answer
is
very
simple
and
by
the
way
I
'm
impressed
you
managed
to
debug
all
the
potential
off-by-one
errors
in
your

.

The
following
line
is
wrong
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2795
(

You
correctly
compute
the
center
index
and
change
amount
but
you
missed
that
the
change
should
be
applied
to
the
midpoint
in
terms
of
height
.

That
is
:

CODE_BLOCK

A_2796
(

I
'm

you
get
the
idea
.

The
problem
seems
to
be
that
you
are
changing
only
the
midpoint
of
each
line
segment
,
rather
than
changing
the
rest
of
the
line
segment
in
proportion
to
its
distance
from
each
end
to
the
midpoint
.

The
following

to
give
you
something
more

what
you
're
looking
for
:

Within

of
awaiting

CODE_BLOCK

Q_5406
(
code
omitted

If
my
request
is
not
called
for
at
least
5
minutes
,
then
any
new
call
will
see
the
duration
of
OpenAsync
be
huge
(
c
.
3s
)
instead
of
immediate
.

I
'd
like
to
understand
the
reason
to
eradicate
that
crazy
slowness
.

UPDATE

I
created
an
endpoint
just
to
open
the
SqlConnection
.

If
I
wait
more
than
5
minutes
then
call
that
OpenConnection
endpoint
then
call
any
another
request
,
the
OpenConnection
will
incur
the
waiting
cost
mentioned
above
but
the
request
will
not
.

Hence
,
I
've
scheduled
a
job
on
Azure
to
run
every
minute
and
call
the
OpenConnection
endpoint
.

However
,
when
I
make
requests
from
my
http
client
,
I
incur
the
waiting
time
.

As
if
opened
the
SqlConnection
was
somehow
linked
to
the
http
client
ip.
.

Also
,
that
5
minutes
windows
is
typical
of
DNS
TTL.
.

However
3s
for
a
DNS
lookup
of
the
Database
endpoint
is
too
long
.

It
ca
n't
be
that
.

UPDATE
2

Time
observed
at
the
htt
client
level
seems
to
be
the
result
of
both
awaiting
for
the
connection
as
well
as
some
other
latencies
(
dns
lookup
?
)
.

Here
is
a
table
summarizing
what
I
observe
:

UPDATE
3

The
difference
between
row
3
and
4
of
my
table
is
time
spent
in
TCP/IP
Connect
and
HTTPS
Handshake
according
to
Fiddler
.

Let
's
not
focus
on
it
on
that
post
but
only
on
the
time
spent
waiting
for
the
SqlConnection
to
open
.

UPDATE
4

Actually
I
think
both
two
waiting
times
have
the
same
reason
.

The
server
needs
to
"
keep
alive
"
its
connection
to
the
database
and
the
client
needs
to
"
keep
alive
"
its
connection
to
the
server
.

UPDATE
5

I
had
a
job
running
every
4
minutes
to
open
the
SqlConnection
but
once
in
a
while
it
was
incurring
the
waiting
cost
.

So
I
think
the
inactivity
time
is
4
minutes
not
5
(
hence
I
updated
this
post
title
)
.

So
I
updated
my
scheduled
job
to
run
every
minute
.

then
I
realised
it
was
still
incurring
the
waiting
cost
but
regularly
every
30
minutes
(
hence
I
updated
this
post
title
)
.

These
two
times
strangely
correlates
with
those
of
Azure

Idle

I

-

some

some
not

I
have
a
2-million
point
data
set
,
generated

There

several

I
am
interested
on
three
and
on
a
factor
that
describe
the
class
for
that
data
point
.

Here
is
a
short
snippet
of

that
reads
the

I
use
the

CODE_BLOCK

(

Here
is
the
result

As
expected
,
points
from
class
E
are
in
vast
majority
,
so
I
cannot
see
points
of
other
classes
.

The
problem
is
that
I
expected
the
points
to
be
plotted
in
magenta
(
classes
are
A
,
B
,
C
,
D
,
E
,
N

CODE_BLOCK

The
question
is
,
why
on
the
first
plot
the
points
are
blue
instead
of
magenta
?

This
question
is
somehow
similar
to
Color
gradient
for
elevation
data
in
a
XYZ
plot
with
R
and
Lattice
but
now
I
am
using

scatterplot

I
've
also
read
Changing

-
grouping

(

)
does
not
solve
my

,
plots
are
still
in

separated
by

Your
code
lacks
error
condition
checking
.

First
and
foremost
I
suggest
you
check
the
error
code
status
after
each
and
every
OpenGL
and
CUDA
call
.

I
've
got
a
very
strong
hunch
what
the
problem
is
and
adding
the
error
checking
will
tell
if
this
is
the
case
.

So
:
I
see
that
you
never
properly
unbind
the
PBO
from
OpenGL
before
trying
to
map
it
to
a
CUDA
pointer
.

Depending
on
the
path
your
program
takes
this
may
result
in
the
PBO
actually
not
getting
mapped
,
hence
giving
you
an
invalid
pointer
that
if
accessed
,
from
the
CUDA
kernel
or
the
host
,
will
result
in
a
segfault
.

To
pin
down
the
problem
check
the
error
status
of
every
OpenGL
and
CUDA
operation
.

CUDA
will
tell
you
if
it
ca
n't
map
a
OpenGL
resource
,
for
whatever
reason
(
like
the
resource
still
being
bound
to
a
OpenGL
functional
unit
)

As
for
the
other
answers/comments
,
Tier-0
bundles
are
not
possible
at
the
moment
.

Despite
this
,
you
still
can
go
ahead
and
create
a
bundle
of
free
apps
:

this
will
be
created
,
can
even
go
through
the
review
and
be
approved
,
but
it
wo
n't
be
made
available
to
the

because
"
you
must
choose
a

"
(
and
you
ca
n't
ask
for

,
a.k.a
.

tier-1
,
for

)
.

I

created

:
if

that

should
exist

Since
both

are
of
type
DateTime
,
the

on
them
is
going
to
check
each
bit
for
a
full

object
.

If

loop
until

I
'm
using
Postgres
.

I
have
a
table
of
Artices
in
my
database
,
with
a
column
url
for
url
slugs
.

These
are
so
that
I
can
display
the
articles
in
that
table
on
a
website
as
not
"
example.com/23323
"
but
instead
as
"
example.com/Funny_Thing_Happened_to_Me
"
.

This
was
straightforward
enough
to
implement
,
and
then
as
the
number
of
articles
grew
,
I
added
an
index
to
the
table
on
the
url
slugs
.

I
have
since
realized
that
while
I
want
to
be
able
to
display
capitalized
letters
in
the
urls
,
I
want
them
to
be
case
insensitive
in

of
what
the
user
types
in
,
and
I
want
to
enforce

on

in
a

manner
.

Is
there
a
straightforward
way
to
quickly
search
based
on
a
text
column
in
a
case
insensitive
way
,
and
also
enforce
uniqueness
in
a
case
insensitive
way
?

I
've
tried
conducting
the
searches
with
something
like
lower(url)
=
but
that
causes
Postgres
to
decide
not
to
use
the
index
at
all
.

There

a
problem
in

implementation
.

When
-collectionView
:
cellForItemAtIndexPath

calling

the

code
on
the

.

Assuming
that
-downloadImageWithURL

method
performs
image
loading
on
the
background
thread
and
returns
instantly
we
can
call
it
without
dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue
()
...
wrapping
.

Otherwise
we
cannot
guarantee
that
the
completion
handler
is
executing

so
the

the

I
am
tring
to
do
occlusion
with

Tango
in

.

What
I

pretty
simple
to
understand
:
when
there
is
a
real
object
in
front
of
a
virtual
object
,
the
virtual
object
is
hidden
(
or
rendered
differently
)

The
perfect
result
would
be
like
it
is
in
this
impressive
video
I
found
:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpDhaM7ZhZs
.

I
already
tried
the
"
Enable
occlusion
"
option
of
the
Tango
Camera
and
I
am
not
so
happy
with
the
results
(
it
is
not
accurate
and
not
real
time
as
it
is
based
on
mesh
reconstruction
from
the
point
cloud
)
.

If
you
have
hints
,
tips
or
ideas
about
how
to
achieve
this
(
like
in
the
video
)
,
that
would

!

Answer_to_Question_ID

Occlusion
is
still
a
very
experimental
feature
on
Tango
.

The
problem
is
that
it
's
very
hard
to
do
occlusion
with
high
fidelity
and
high
performance
,
here
's
couple
of
ideas
on
how
to
achieve
it
using
different
method
:

Use
3D
reconstruction
.

Tango
does
provide
functionalities
to
construct
3D
meshes
from
point
cloud
,
you
can
find
sample
code
from
Tango
sample
code
repository
(
C
,
Java
,
Unity
)
.

If
you
have
a
world
that
is
pre-scanned
,
you
can
essentially
use
that
mesh
data
to
occluded
virtual
object
.

Run
time
up-sampling
depth
image
.

You
can
also
project
all
point
clouds
on
to
an
image
plane
,
up-sample
it
,
and
use
the
image
as
a
depth
buffer
for
rendering
.

This
is
what
ARScreen
occlusion
is
using
in
TangoUnitySDK
.

Due
to
the
limitation
of
Tango
depth
sensing
hardware
,
the
result
quality
is
not
very
ideal
,
and
it
will
not
work
if
all
physical
objects
are
far
away
(
beyond
4
meters
)
from
the
device
.

Yes

you

On

in

,
you
can
output
the

by
using

this

worth
noting
that
even
though
named
"
hidden
field
"
,
the
values
are
easily
accessible
to
anyone
using
your
form
,
and
after
the
page
loads
and
your
PHP
is
output
,
they
can
be
changed
to
anything
very
easily
and
then
submitted
.

So
if
you
have
any
restrictions
on
what
events
are
shown
to
what
users
,
someone
can
potentially
just
replace
the
title
in
their
form
with
an
event
they
should
n't
be
able
to
rsvp
for
,
but
you
'd
never
know
that
from
the
email
you
receive
.

But
that
's
a
whole
other
question
.

Resizing
the
window
does
n't
cause
Angular
to
re-run
a
$digest
loop
,
so
window.innerWidth
'
s
value
is
checked
only
when
something
else
causes
it
.

You
should
instead
use
a
directive
(
ie
.
do
n't
do
this
work
in
your
controller
)
,
binding
to
the
window.onresize
event
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3259
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

In
this
case
,
you
call
scope
.
$
apply
.

This
causes
the
$digest
loop
to
run
following
this
event
,
which
is
outside
of
the
Angular
context
.

You
can
use
this
directive
to
decorate
an
element
on
the
same
scope
as
the
variable
you
're
changing

If

you
can
simply

inject
the

If

based

supplied
then
you
have
to
use

Consider

(

While
the

holds
:

I
am
facing
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_383
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Why
?

I
mean
,
it
's
clear
that
making
a
Set
out
of
a
Seq
chooses
random
elements
in
case
of
duplicates
,
but
there
are
no
duplicates
because
of
"(...).distinct.sameElements(...)"
.

I
certainly
need
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
kind
of
equality
check.
.

EDIT
:

After
a
long
search
,
I
found
the
problem
and
condensed
it
to
the
following
:

My
elements
are
not
the
same
,
however
I
must
take
a
closer
look
why
distinct.sameElements
is
n't
complaining
.

But
meanwhile
a
new
question
arose
:

Consider
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_384
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

So
my
elements
in
my
first
to
sequences
are
n't
the
same
because
they
depend
on
a
m2-construct
and
so
each
time
a
accessing
them
they
are
different
.

My
new
question
is
,
why
does
m2
behave
like
a
function
in
contrast
to
m1
although
both
are
immutable
maps
.

That
is
n't
intuitively
for
me
.

Question_URL

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5433578/

The
most
common
reasons
for
problems
in
this
area--testing
set
equality
and
the
like--are

hashCode
does
not
agree
with
equals

Your
values
are
not
stable
(
so
previous
hashCode
does
not
agree
with
current
equals
)

The
reason
is
that
this
matters
is
that
distinct
and
toSet
use
hash
codes
to
build
sets
,
whereas
contains
simply
runs
over
the
collection
with
an
exists
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_587
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
is
made
more
complicated
by
the
fact
that
many
sets
do
n't
start
using
hash
codes
until
they
're
larger
than
some
minimal
size
(
usually
4)
,
so
you
do
n't
always
notice
this
with
testing
.

But
let
's
prove
it
to
ourselves
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_588
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Okay
,
so
now
we
know
that
for
most
of
these
operations
,
matching
up
hashCode
and
equals
is
a
Good
Thing
.

Warning
:
in
Java
,
mismatches
happens
frequently
even
with
primitives
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_589
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

but
Scala
now
at
least
catches
that
(
hopefully
every
time
)
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_590
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Case
classes
also
do
this
properly
,
so
we
're
left
with
three
possibilities

You
overrode
equals
but
not
hashCode
to
match

Your
values
are
not
stable

There
is
a
bug
and
Java
wrapped
primitive
hashCode
mismatch
is
coming
back
to
bite
you

The
first
one
is
easy
enough
.

The
second
one
seems
to
be
your
problem
,
and
it
arises
from
the
fact
that
mapValues
actually
creates
a
view
of
the
original
collection
,
not
a
new
collection
.

(
filterKeys
does
this
also
.
)

Personally
,
I
think
this
is
a
questionable
choice
of
design
,
since
normally
when
you
have
a
view
and
you
want
to
make
a
single
concrete
instance
of
it
,
you
.force
it
.

But
default
maps
do
n't
have
a
.force
because
they
do
n't
realize
that
they
might
be
views
.

So
you
have
to
resort
to
things
like

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_591
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
is
really
important
if
you
're
doing
things
like
file
IO
to
map
your
values
(
e.g
.
if
your
values
are
filenames
and
you
're
mapping
to
their
contents
)
and
you
do
n't
want
to
read
the
file
over
and
over
again
.

But
your
case--where
you
're
assigning
random
values--is
another
where
it
is
important
to
pick
a
single
copy
,
not
recreate
the
values
over
and
over
.

there
are
many
posts
that
deal
with
validation
controls
inside
update
panel
and
partial
page
rendering
.

But
i
got
a
different
problem
here
,
i
did
try
updating
to
sp1
.NET
framework
2.0
and
again
.NET
Framework
4.0
but
nothing
happens
.

Basically
i
got
a
dropdownlist
inside
update
panel
whose
autopostback
is
set
to
true
and
an
empty
item
-
-
Select
-
-
is
added
as
index
0
for
validation
(
Required
Field
Validator
)
purpose
.

I
does
happen
that
even
when
i
select
index
0
,
the
validation
message
appears
briefly
and
then
partial
postback
takes
place
.

Does
anyone
have
any
reasons
for
the
same
or
alternate
ways
to
do
this
.

note
:

I
am
populating
other
controls
(
dropdownlist
)
during
the
selected
index
changed
event
.

I
could
use
cascading
dropdownlist
from
AjaxControlToolkit
but
then
i
lose
event
validation
functionality
that
other
controls
need
.

To
unsubscribe
your
app
from
a
Facebook
page
,
you
do
not
need
a
token
from
the
page
.

All
you
need
is
your
App
Access

.

To
unsubscribe
from
the
page
just
make
a
DELETE
http
request
to
:

CODE_BLOCK

A_7031
(

You
can
get

by
sending
a

So
just
make

I

that
you
will
get
imediatly
the

then
updates

It
is
because
"

import
"

.

You
can
solve
this
by
setting
"
org.osgi.framework.system.packages.extra
=
sun.misc
"

EDIT

:

I
start
the
OSGi

But
I
guess
you
can
directly
put
this
setting
in
the
"
felix.config.properties

.

The
problems
occurs
because
sun.misc

private

.

So
you
have
to
explicitly
add
the

as
an

Does

any

i.e

Vs

CODE_BLOCK

I
think
keeping

assigning

?

Answer_to_Question_ID

Question_URL

You
might
need
to
implement
a
performance
test
to
be
sure
about
the
actual
difference
,
but
I
guess
it
should
be
a
minimal
impact
,
because
binding
events
on
the
document
will
mean
that
you
catch
any
element
event
once
it
bubbles
to
the
top-most
element
in
the
document
.

Anyways
,
skipping
the
"
performance
argument
"
,
your
case
looks
better
when
you
bind
a
handler
on
the
nearest
parent
.

It
's
not
only
about
performance
:
it
's
more
logical
.

Nearly
.

In
POSIX
regexes
,
parentheses
and
other
special
characters
have
to
be
escaped
if
you
want
them
to
match
themselves
,
not
to
access
their
special
function
,
so
it
has
to
be

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3765
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

In
addition
,
if
you
want
the
captures
,
you
have
to
compile
the
regex
without
REG_NOSUB
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3766
(
code
omitted

and
..
the
printf
will
probably
segfault

you

the
arguments
do
n't
match
the
format
string

Ah
,
but
it
does
'
contain
required
fields
'
.

To
elaborate.
.

InnoDB
includes
all
the
columns
of
the
PRIMARY
KEY
in
each
'
secondary
'
index
.

So
,

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5455
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

is
really
more
like

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5456
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

In
your
example
,
that
includes
all
the
columns
.

Hence
,
everything
in
the
SELECT
,
including
*
is
found
in
that
secondary
index
.

So
,
"
Using
index
"
is
'
correct
'
.

This
is
one
way
in
which
InnoDB
is
sometimes
better
than
MyISAM
.

Try
EXPLAIN
FORMAT
=
JSON
SELECT
..
.
to
get
more
details

I
have
had
a
few
items
come
up
recently
where
I
have
a
need
to
execute
a
method
immediately
after
initial
screen
load
.

For
example
a
couple
scenario's
:

1)
Processing
screen
where
the
data
shown
in
the
processing
screen
comes
from
an
external
API
(
dynamically
loaded
and
parsed
,
then
displayed
for
processing
)

2)
Automatically
load
a
second
window/tab
when
the
screen
finishes
loading
based
on
data
in
the
record
.

3)
A
popup
prompt
after
screen
load
notifying
the
user
of
a
situation
on
the
item
the
loaded
.

All
three
of
these
present
different
challenges
which
lead
me
to
wonder
if
what
the
best
day
to
handle
these
would
be
.

For
example
,
item
1
-
currently
I
have
an
a
call
in
the
"
GetRecords
"
override
that
if
the
View
contains
no
records
,
calls
the
a
long
running
process
to
go
grab
the
records
.

While
this
works
,
I
'm
presented
with
two
issues

If
I
let
the
long
process
run
and
then
request
a
refresh
,
the
user
has
the
ability
to
click
"
Process/Process
All
"
before
data
is
available
.

This
also
effects
scheduling
of
the
process
.

If
I
block
the
process
with
a
WaitTillCompleted
,
the
user
is
presented
with
a
standard
page
loading
spinner
instead
of
the
"
Long
running
Process
"
indicator
but
allows
scheduling
to
work
correctly
.

For
#2
/3
,
the
request
for
the
new
window/tab
and
the
popup
both
seem
to
be
initiated
from
a
postback
to
function
correctly
.

That
leads
me
to
believe
I
need
a
javascript
method
to
run
after
the
page
finishes
init
to
execute
the
appropriate
actions
.

Is
there
a
better
way
to
handle
either
of
these
situations
with
native
framework
methods
?

The
advantage
of
modifying
an
argument
instead
of
returning
a
new
instance
is
that
you
put
control
of
instantiation
in
the
hands
of
the
calling
code
-
i.e
.

you
allow
it
to
re-use
an
existing
instance
.

The
'
modifying
argument
'
approach
allows
you
to
initialise
an
object
using
several
such
methods
.

e.g
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_1875
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Arguably
you
could
do
the
same
thing
by
returning
the
same
instance
as
was
passed
in
as
a
parameter
,
but
I
personally
think
that
's
asking
for
trouble
.

Another
possible
reason
might
be
if
the
cost
of
instantiation
was
high
,
you
might
want
to
recycle
an
old
object
.

This
does
n't
appear
to
be
the
case
with
the
code
you
present
though
,
and
it
's
an
optimisation
so
only
think
about
doing
this
if
absolutely
necessary
!

Personally
I
would
tend
to
take
the
'
return
a
new
instance
'
approach
unless
there
's
a
specific
reason
not
to
.

I
think
it
's
simpler
and
decreases
the
likelihood
of
subtle
errors
in
the
calling
code
.

To

.
well

you

However
,
frankly
I
do
n't

In

,
I
would
strongly
advise
limiting
how
much
your

knows
about
the
request
model
,
and
simply
figure
out
what
the

needs

and
give

exactly
that

Let

I
have
a
single
page
application
using
AngularJS
and
I
am
facing
one
performance
issue
in
it
.

My
application
processes
incoming
events
from
the
server
side
which
are
passed
to
the
AngularJS
framework
on
the
client
side
using
ASP.NET
SignalR
.

There
are
millions
of
events
that
can
be
received
by
my
application
and
there
is
no
performance
issue
on
the
server
side
and
it
easily
passes
these
number
of
events
one
after
the
other
to
the
AngularJS
framework
.

The
problem
lies
on
the
client
side
.

After
processing
the
event
,
i
use
$scope.$apply()
to
update
the
page
and
display
the
events
.

In
such
a
case
where
there
are
multiple
events
being
received
one
after
the
other
,
calling
$scope.$apply()
every
time
slows
down
the
application
and
does
not
show
the
events
quickly
.

The
events
will
be
passed
at
random
so
I
do
n't
even
know
how
any
events
will
be
received
by
my
application
at
any
point
in
time
.

Any
ideas
on
how
to
get
this
issue
resolved
will
be
very
helpful
.

Thanks

What
else
would
you
expect
?

The
loop
is
executed
15
times
.

On
the
14th
time
,
x
is
1.4
and
so
you
add
another
0.1
,
making
it
1.5
.

If
you
expect
the
loop
to
terminate
at
1.4
,
you
should
increment
x
before
checking
the
while
condition
,
not
after
that
.

If
you
expect
the
loop
to
terminate
on
1.41
,
your
increment
is
wrong
and
you
should
do

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5832
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

instead
,
making
it
141
iterations
.

As
for
the
second
question
,
I
am
aware
that
Float
should
not
be
used
for
monetary
calculations
and
such
due
to
its
lack
of
precision
.

However
,
I
trusted
Double
so
far
,
and
the
while
loop
in
run
15
actually
claims
the
Double
value
to
be
less
than
1.0
while
it
is
reported
to
be
1.0
.

We
have
got
a
precision
problem
here
,
as
we
can
see
if
we
substract
x
from
1.0
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5833
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

which
returns
:
1.11022302462516e-16

At
the
same
time
,
Float
seems
to
be
unprecise
in
the
other
direction
.

In
the
last
run
,
it
is
a
little
bigger
than
0.9
(
0.9
+
5.96046e-08
)
,
making
it
bigger
than
10
in
the
following
run
.

The
reason
why
Double
and
Float
are
wrong
in
different
directions
is
just
a
matter
of
how
the
values
are
stored
,
and
the
result
will
be
different
depending
on
the
number
.

For
example
,
with
2.0
both
actual
values
are
bigger
:
Double
by
4.440892.e-16
and
Float
by
2.38419e-07
.

For
3.0
Double
is
bigger
by
1.33226e-15
and
Float
smaller
by
7.1525e-07
.

The
same
problems
occur
using
x.isLess(than:1.0)
,
but
this
method
is
the
basis
for
the
<
operator
as
of
https://developer.apple.com/reference/swift/floatingpoint/1849403-isless

isLessThanOrEqualTo(1.0)
,
on
the
other
hand
,
seems
to
work
reliably
as
expected
.

This
answer
is
pretty
much
a
question
itself
by
now
,
so
I
'm
curious
if
anyone
has
an
in-depth
explanation
of
this
..
.

Update

The
more
I
think
about
it
,
the
less
of
a
Swift
problem
it
is
.

Basically
,
you
have
that
problem
in
all
floating
point
calculations
,
because
they
are
never
precise
.

Both
Float
and
Double
are
not
precise
,
Double
is
just
twice
as
accurate
.

However
,
this
means
that
comparisons
like
==
are
useless
with
floating
point
values
unless
they
are
both
rounded
.

Therefore
,
good
advice
in
loops
like
those
of
yours
with
a
known
precision
(
in
your
case
one
decimal
)
would
be
to
round
to
that
precision
before
doing
any
kind
of
comparison
.

For
example
,
this
would
fix
the
loop
:

The
DevTools
can
update
any
files
that
are
editable
via
Sources
,
including
PHP
and
HTML
.

CSS
is
only
updated
directly
via
the
elements
panel
.

Other
text
file
types
can
be
updated
through
the
Sources
panel
where
you
map
the
files
.

DevTools
directly
has
no
knowledge
of
FTP/SFTP/FUSE
mounts/etc
.

All
it
knows
is
local
filesystem
structures
.

So
,
if
you
use
some
software
to
mount
a
remote
filesystem
locally
as
a
new
folder
or
drive
,
then
you
can
map
it
to
DevTools
just
fine
.

I
have
done
this
myself
in
the
past
and
have
seen
others
do
this
setup
as
well
.

You
simply
need
to
research
your
OS
and
see
what
software
is
available
that
you
are
comfortable
with
to
handle
the
mounting
.

Warning
though
,
with
large
project
file
structures
this
can
make
things
slow
.

I
have
a
JSON
response
from
PHP
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_2315
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

What
I
want
to
do
with
this
is
out
output
the
order
number
which
is
always
the
same
in
an
element
with
an
id
of
#ordernum
.

Then
for
the
other
parts
,
i
want
to
create
a
couple
of
divs
within
a
container
div
for
the
name
and
id
.

I
'm
pretty
sure
I
can
get
that
bit
working
but
what
i
'm
unsure
of
is
how
to
loop
through
each
of
the
JSON
rows
to
get
to
the
part
where
i
can
create
my
divs

This
is
what
I
have
so
far
but
this
appends
to
a
div
where
i
want
to
create
new
divs
.

Would
i
need
to
do
another
$.each()
after
$('#ordernum').text(row[0].order)
;
?

EDIT

This
is
how
the

is
created

$rows
is
from
a

from

and
I
loop
through
that
to
get
all
the

from
the

I
think
everthing
is
working
right

just
response.order
will
say
undefined
.

if
.each
loop
is
not
working
as
saying
then
put
before
loop

var
response
=
$.parseJSON(response)
.

and
if
u
need
resopnse
like

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2911
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

then
in
php
code
you
can
do
in
second
last
line

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2912
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

then
you
will
not
need
index
in
javascript
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2913
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

put
this
code
in
fire
bug
console
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2914
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

and
check
the
result

and
you
can
create
your
div
under
first
loop
,
you
do
not
need
second
like
even
you
do
not
change
your
response
,
or
you
reformat
that
.

I
am
writing
a
Django
project
which
will
use
Chrome
Headless
to
produce
PDF
documents
.

There
are
lots
of
Apps
,
each
of
which
will
produce
PDFs
,
so
it
made
sense
to
have
a
class
,
that
launches
Chrome
,
makes
a
connection
to
it
,
and
kills
the
Chrome
process
when
the
class
is
deleted
.

There
will
be
a
class
method
,
which
opens
a
new
tab
,
renders
some
HTML
,
and
returns
the
PDF
data
,
and
closes
the
tab
.

It
seems
slightly
inefficient
to
create
a
new
instance
of
the
Class
,
every
time
I
want
to
print
a
PDF
(
which
is
the
primary
purpose
of
the
project
)
.

It
seems
better
to
create
a
global
instance
of
the
Class
,
and
have
one
copy
of
headless
Chrome
running
the
whole
time
,
rather
than
starting
Chrome
,
connecting
to
it
,
getting
the
PDF
data
,
and
then
closing
everything
every
time
.

Other
posts
on
this
issue
,
suggest
that
any
kind
of
global
variable
(
aside
from
some
constants
in
settings
)
is
a
bad
idea
.

In
this
particular
case
,
is
this
still
a
bad
idea
?

Why
is
this
the
case
?

Importantly
,
is
there
an
alternative
approach
?

Just

For

Couple
things
.

As
mentioned
in
the
comments
by
VKP
,
you
cannot
pull
from
the
CASE
statement
in
the
same
query
,
to
get
around
that
you
can
just
create
an
additional
SELECT
for
the
CASE
statement

Second
,
when
using
CASE
you
do
n't
need
the
equal
sign
(=
)
after
THEN
.

"
THEN
"
is
essentially
the
equal
sign
so
just
put
the
values
you
want
it
to
equal
.

If
you
try
this
the
query
runs
succesfully
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4961
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

However
,
as
it
currently
is
this
query
will
just
provide
a
number
of
NULL
values
equal
to
the
length
of
the
@vocales
value
.

This
is
because
the
value
of
parameter
@resultado
is
never
declared
and
in
your
CASE
statement
you
are
adding
a
NULL
value
to
a
known
value
which
will
always
equal
NULL
.

Let
me
know
what
output
you
are
looking
for
and
I
can
revise
my
query
to
help
you
get
there
.

A
node
app
will
stay
alive
as
long
as
there
are
active
elements
that
can
still
receive
events
.

This
can
include
a
TCP
connection
,
a
listening
server
,
a
timer
,
etc
..
.

As
soon
as
none
of
those
exist
any
more
and
the
event
queue
is
empty
and
the
flow
of
control
returns
back
to
the
system
(
e.g
.
no
JS
is
executing
)
,
then
the
node
app
will
shut
itself
down
.

The
idea
is
that
if
nothing
is
running
that
could
possible
create
more
events
in
the
future
,
then
there
's
nothing
else
that
can
happen
in
this
node
app
so
it
must
be
done
.

If
you
're
saying
that
when
you
try
to
run
your
app
again
,
it
wo
n't
start
any
more
,
then
that
is
a
different
issue
.

You
will
need
to
do
some
logging
of
errors
and
debugging
to
figure
out
why
that
may
be
.

If
you
just
log
every
possible
place
you
could
get
an
error
in
your
app
start-up
code
,
you
will
probably
discover
where
the
error
is
that
is
keeping
it
from
starting
.

Since
you
've
provided
not
details
that
we
could
go
on
to
know
what
issue
might
be
preventing
that
,
I
can
list
some
common
things
:

Some
process
is
still
running
that
has
control
of
some
resource
(
such
as
a
port
)
and
when
you
try
to
restart
your
app
,
it
shuts
down
when
it
ca
n't
access
that
resource
.

Some
process
is
still
running
and
has
open
file
resources
,
restricting
your
ability
to
access
those
files
.

To
start
with
,
I
'd
check
your
OS
process
manager
to
verify
that
your
original
app
instance
is
not
still
running
.

The
symptoms
you
describe
make
it
sound
like
it
is
probably
still
running
and
holding
onto
some
resources
that
keep
your
app
from
running
again
.

This
part
has
me
confused
when
you
say
"
start
the
entire
process
again
"
when
your
wed
socket
closes
.

Are
you
literally
trying
to
exec
node
server.js
again
from
within
your
app
?

Or
,
what
are
you
actually
trying
to
do
there
?

We
probably
need
to
see
that
code
to
help
you
with
that
particular
action
.

FYI
,
it
should
be
no
big
deal
to
just
re-establish
a
webSocket
connection
after
it
closed
.

You
should
n't
have
to
restart
your
whole
app
just
to
do
that
.

instead
of
a

Set

like

to
make

Yes
,
there
is
such
a
possibility
,
in
such
cases
,
implement
attached
behavior
.

Logic
at
work
with
a
focus
must
fit
into
DependencyPropertyChangedEvent
handler
.

Here
is
an
example
for
your
case
:

XAML

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2972
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Code-behind

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2973
(
code

Answer_to_Question_ID

Question_URL

It
should
be
relatively
straightforward
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2974
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
works
because
all
controls
inherit
from
FrameworkElement
which
inherits
from
DependencyObject
.

So
you
can
set
ctrl
to
any
type
of
control
you
want
:
ComboBox
,
TextBox
,
Button
,
Canvas
,
etc
.

I
've

persistent
footers/headers
in
a
jqm
app
I

working

.

They
work
pretty
much
as
expected
,
except
when
you
tapping
in
the
"
white
space
"
anywhere
inside
the
[
data-role="content"
]
,
the
header
and
footer
scroll
out

Tapping
in
the

where
there
are
no

or

again
slides
the

and

back
into
place
.

Here
is
a
prototype
of
the
app
I

working
on

It
's
appropriate
for
pages
where
there
is
a

You
get
more
screen
real

for
reading
the

That
's

-

that
's
shorter
than
the

length
on

,
the

actually
climbs
up

That
's
not

As

procedure
,
you
can
do
:

Allocate
an
array
of
pointers
to
chars

Read
all
lines
of
the
file
.

Allocate
a
new
string
for
each
line
and
put
in
the
array

If
the

is

small
,
then
use
realloc

.

Read

Once

use

sort

It

But
to

you
have

regex
.

it

to
allow

horizontal

as

This
can
be
done
with

group
\h

Mechanize
does
not
offer
javascript
functionality
,
so
you
will
not
see
dynamic
content
(
like
a
timer
that
turns
into
a
link
)
.

As
far
as
clicking
on
a
link
,
you
have
to
find
the
element
,
and
then
you
can
call
click_link
on
it
.

See
the
Finding
Links
section
of
this
site
.

If
you
are
looking
for
something
to
handle
such
sites
,
a
good
option
is
PhantomJS
.

It
uses
nodejs
,
but
runs
on
the
webkit
engine
,
allowing
you
parse
dynamic
content
.

If
you
have
your
heart
set
on
python
,
using
Selenium
to
programatically
drive
a
real
browser
may
be
your
best
bet
.

If
it
's
an
anchor
tag
,
then
just
GET/POST
whatever
it
is
.

The
timer
between
links
appearing
is
generally
done
in
javascript
-
some
sites
you
are
attempting
to
scrape
may
not
be
usable
without
javascript
,
or
requires
a
token
generated
in
javascript
with
clientside
math
.

Depending
on
the
site
,
you
can
either
extract
the
wait
time
in
msec/sec
and
time.sleep()
for
that
long
,
or
you
'll
have
to
use
something
that
can
execute
javascript

Why
do
n't
you
use
Adjacency
Matrix
,
it
's
pretty
simple
and
easy
.

Adjacency
matrices
are
matrices
which
define
relations
between
the
vertices
of
a
graph
.

See
in
the
example
above
,
you
have
an
edge
going
from
vertex
1
to
2
,
so
there
is
a
1
at
the
index
[
1
]
[
2
]
of
adjacency
matrix
,
similar
is
the
case
with
[
1
]
[
3
]
and
so
on
.

And
you
do
n't
have
any
edge
going
from
1
to
5
,
so
there
is
a
0
at
index
[
1
]
[
5
]
,
and
so
on
.

You
can
also
use
Adjacency
List
,
now
go
ahead
and
google
it
to
have
some
understanding
of
how
to
use
Adjacency
Matrices
and
Adjacency
Lists
,
and
come
back
with
some
real
problem
then
.

EDIT

I
see
,
you
do
n't
have
any
understanding
of
how
to
implement
a
graph
,
let
me
write
some
examples
for
you
using
Adjacency
Matrix
.

I
'm
assuming
that
you
know
how
to
allocate
a
2D
array
in
c++
.

Now
,
if
you
want
to
create
an
adjacency
matrix
for
a
graph
containing
n
vertices
,
simply
create
a
2D
array
of
size
n
x
n
and
initialize
all
of
the
elements
in
it
with
0
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5668
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

There
you
go
,
call
this
function
,
and
you
've
created
yourself
an
Adjacency
Matrix
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5669
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Now
,
you
can
do
whatever
you
want
to
do
with
your
graph
(
For
now
,
it
does
n't
have
any
edges
)
.

To
have
edges
in
it
,
simply
place
1
wherever
you
want
to
put
an
edge
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5670
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Now
,
simply
call
this
function
,
and
add
some
edges
to
your
graph
.

So
i
'm
gonna
put
some
edges
and
create
the
above
shown
graph
in
it
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5671
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Now
,
you
can
do
whatever
you
want
with
your
graph
,
like
should
we
calculate
how
many
outgoing
edges
vertex
1
has
?

For
this
,
you
can
simply
loop
through
the
row
1

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5672
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

At
the
end
,
you
should
de-allocate
the
allocated
memory
for
adjacency
graph
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5673
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

So
,
i
think
by
now
,
you
'd
have
much
better
understanding
.

I
've
implemented
the
graph
with
using
just
the
functions
,
and
passing
adjacency
matrix
to
them
(
my
bad
)
,
I
strongly
recommend
to
implement
the
Graph
in
a
class
,
which
handles
all
of
the
Graph
stuff
itself
,
and
you
do
n't
have
to
pass
adjacency
matrix
to
it
,
you
should
n't
even
have
to
know
whether
the
Graph
class
is
implemented
using
Adjacency
Matrix
or
some
other
method
(
of
course
when
using
the
class
,
not
implementing
it
)

You
class
should
be
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5674
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Now
,
go
ahead
and
implement
this
class
and
add
whatever
functions
you
want
in
there
.

If

in

horizontally
,
just
provide
a
width
to
the

element
and
use
margin

;
that
's
all
you
need
,
if
you

you

When
you
use
Chrome
and
request
the
same
resource
in
multiple
tabs
,
it
will
wait
for
the
resource
to
finish
downloading
in
one
.

The
reason
is
that
if
the
headers
allow
,
the
second
tab
will
load
from
cache
,
rather
than
reloading
it
from
the
server
.

This
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
server
configuration
,
but
more
to
do
with
your
flawed
test
method
.

Fire
off
a
couple
wget
calls
from
the
command
line
,
and
this
will
likely
work
as
expected
.

You
can
also
verify
that
this
is
happening
by
using
a
debugging
proxy
,
such
as

FilterNews()
here

There

Unless

missing
something
fundamental
,
you
ca
n't
select
a

.

You
can
select
the
subitem
in
the
first
column
or
you
can
set
the
FullRowSelect
property
to
True
.

Neither
helps
you
to
determine
what
subitem
the
user
might
be
interested
in
,
there
's
no

to

what

Use

Each

The

running
an

The

The

which
I

just

!

When

as
running

in

,
storing

several
times
is
no

If

non-elevated
,
the
first

of

With

Using

,
I
checked
whether
the

is
actually
being
used

but
only
my

I

Despite
there

There

Might

If

then
it
will
always
hide
the

for

even

If

I

For

Well
,
I
know
it
's
late
-I
had
n't
found
this
post
-
,
but
I
had
the
same
problem
(
though
I
was
just
trying
to
do
a
To-Do
List
)
.

I
've
spent
the
last
three
hour
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
problem
was
and
looking
for
possible
solutions
somewhere
on
the
web
.

Maybe
it
could
help
somebody
else
anyway
,
so
I
'll
put
it
.

In
my
case
what
worked
was
this
:

This
is
part
of
my
Main
Activity
with
the
onCreate
method
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_1606
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

..
.
and
moving
down
to
the
LoaderCallbacks
methods
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_1607
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

So
,
in
my
case
,
the
reason
it
was
n't
working
was
because
the
adapter
was
n't
being
set
to
the
ListView
,
so
my
list
did
n't
show
anything
and
the
methods
newView()
and
bindView()
never
got
called
before
.

Maybe
it
could
work
by
setting
the
adapter
to
the
GridView
on
your
onLoadFinished
,
once
the
cursor
load
has
been
made
.

Do
n't
know
if
it
will
solve
your
problem
or
anyone
else
's
but
it
worked
for
me
.

Hope
it
helps

Uhm

Hence
all
your

you

either
give

perhaps
you

compile

-arch
=
sm_11
flag
.

sm
1.1
is
the
first
architecture
which
supported
atomic
operations
on
global
memory
while
your
GPU
supports
SM
2.0
.

Hence
there
is
no
reason
to
compile
for
SM
1.1
unless
for
backward
compatibility
.

One
possible
issue
could
be
that
SM
1.1
does
not
support
atomic
operations
on
64-bit
ints
in
global
memory
.

So
I
would
suggest
you
recompile
the
code
without
-arch
option
,
or
use
-arch
=
sm_20

As
you
can
see
,
GravityCompat
do
n't
let
me
to
put
right
instead
of
END
or
START
,
and
if
I
put
it
in
the
XML
,
it
crash
.

with
the
next

First
of
all
replace
on
DrawerLayout
the
tools:openDrawer
=
"
start
"
with
tools:openDrawer
=
"
end
"
.

Now
your
problem
is
on
the
toggle
,
which
opens
the
left
drawer
,
and
because
you
have
only
right
drawer
it
throws
the
exception
.

You
can
add
your
own
button
on
the
actionbar
(
on
the
right
side
)
to
open
the
drawer
.

To
do
that
change
your
app_bar.xml
like
this

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4876
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Then
change
your
onCreate
method
from
your
Activity
like
this

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4877
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Also
you
can
find
the
image
for
your
drawer
here
or
here
.

I
hope
this
will
help
you
.

Can
I

I
'd
prefer
to
use

Use
NULL
as
the
parameter
value
instead
of
%
for
your
wildcard
condition

Use
a
CASE
statement
to
convert
an
input
string
to
an
integer
.

Convert
the
wildcard
%
to
a
NULL
.

This
will
give
better
performance
than
implicitly
converting
the
entire
int
column
to
string
.

I

question

What
's
the
best
way
to
implement
Facebook
on
my

?

Add
an
easy
UIWebView
connecting
to
the
Url
of
the

I

Implement
the

I

The
answer
is
"
it
depends
,
"
but
IMHO
you
're
asking
the
wrong
question
.

A
better
question
would
be
"
which
method
of
integrating
with
FB
would
result
in
a
better
experience
for
my
users
?
"

That
is
,
would
your
users
be
best
served
by
"
framing
"
the
standard
FB
web
interface
in
a
UIWebView
?

Or
maybe
they
'd
be
happier
with
just
a
small
piece
of
FB
functionality
embedded
in
your
app
,
like
the
"
upload
to
FB
"
function
in
iMovie
.

Once
you
decide
exactly
what
you
want
to
do
,
how
to
do
it
tends
to
be
fairly
obvious
.

Which
way
to
go
depends
on
what
your
app
does
,
and
how
your
users
will
want
to
do
it
-
and
you
know
that
part
far
better
than
the
rest
of
us
do
!

I

Basically
,
I
used
ShareKit

is
very

indeed

You

It
's
not
clear
from
your
question
whether
this
is
an
option
for
you
,
but
one
possibility
is
to
use
a
title
element
,
rather
than
implementing
your
own
tooltip
.

This
has
the
advantage
of
being
standard
and
simple
,
at
the
expense
of
reducing
possible
customisation
.
