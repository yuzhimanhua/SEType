Just
add
a

I
'm
trying
to
make
a
little
chat
program
after
reading
Beej
's
guide
to
programming
.

And
then
I
was
thinking
about
the
basics
of
the
program
itself
,
and
I
do
n't
know
how
to
print
output
of
recv()
and
get
input
for
send()
at
the
same
time
,
because
the
client
can
always
write
something
and
send
,
but
how
is
it
possible
to
also
print
something
while
he
's
trying
to
input
?

I
thought
about
threads
,
and
I
learned
a
little
bit
about
them
,
and
I
created
2
simple
threads
:
The
first
one
,
prints
a
sentence
every
3
seconds
,
and
the
second
one
get
input
,
this
little
program
of-course
had
a
lot
of
issues
,
for
ex
.

if
you
started
typing
,
and
the
other
thread
needs
to
print
something
,
it
will
simply
take
what
you
wrote
,
and
print
it
with
itself
output
.

Here
is
the
code
,
I
tried
to
recreate
it

I
hope
you
guys
can
help
me

You

:
You

input

Uninitialized
(

have
an

,
and
it
will
seem
to
be

As
the

OP_BLOCK

actually
super()
is
not
syntactic
sugar
,
its
purpose
is
to
invoke
parent
implementation
of
a
certain
method
.

You
have
to
use
super()
when
you
want
to
override
a
parent
method
,
you
do
n't
have
to
use
super()
when
instead
you
want
to
overwrite
a
method
.

The
difference
is
that
in
the
first
case
you
want
to
add
extra
behavior
(
aka
code
execution
)
before
or
after
the
original
implementation
,
in
the
second
you
want
a
completely
different
implementation
.

You
ca
n't
use
self.method_name()
in
an
override
,
the
result
will
be
a
recursion
error
!

(
RuntimeError
:
maximum
recursion
depth
exceeded
)

Example
:

CODE_BLOCK

A_4468
(

Given
a
base
class
A
,
with
a

m
,
B
extends
A
by
overriding
m
,
C
extends
A
by
overwriting
m
,
and
D
generates
an
error
!

EDIT
:

I
just
realized
that
you
actually
have
2
different
methods
(
test_a
and
test_b
)
.

My
answer
is
still
valid
,
but
regarding
your
specific
scenario
:

you
should
use
self.test_a()
unless
you
override/overwrite
that
method
in
your
class
B
and
you
want
to
execute
the
original
implementation.
.
so
we
can
say
that
calling
super().test_a()
or
self.test_a()
it
's
the
same
given
that
you
'll
never
override/overwrite
the
original
test_a()
in
your
subclasses.
.
however
is
a
nonsense
to
use
super()
if
not
for
an
override/overwrite

Answer_to_Question_ID

Question_URL

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31336417/

Usually
you
will
want
to
use
self.test_a()
to
call
an
inherited
method
.

However
,
in
some
rare
situations
you
might
want
to
use
super().test_a()
even
though
it
seems
to
do
the
same
thing
.

They
're
not
equivalent
,
even
though
they
have
the
same
behavior
in
your
example
.

To
explore
the
differences
,
lets
make
two
versions
of
your
B
class
,
one
with
each
kind
of
call
,
then
make
two
C
classes
that
further
extend
the
B
classes
and
override
test_a
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4469
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

When
you
call
the
test_b()
method
on
C1
and
C2
instances
you
'll
get
different
results
,
even
though
B1
and
B2
behave
the
same
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4470
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
is
because
the
super()
call
in
B2.test_b
tells
Python
that
you
want
to
skip
the
version
of
test_a
in
any
more
derived
class
and
always
call
an
implementation
from
a
parent
class
.

(
Actually
,
I
suppose
it
could
be
a
sibling
class
in
a
multiple
inheritance
situation
,
but
that
's
getting
even
more
obscure
.
)

Like
I
said
at
the
top
,
you
usually
want
to
allow
a
more-derived
class
like
the
Cs
to
override
the
behavior
of
the
inherited
methods
you
're
calling
in
your
less-derived
class
.

That
means
that
most
of
the
time
using
self.whatever
is
the
way
to
go
.

You
only
need
to
use
super
when
you
're
doing
something
fancy
.

The
Haskell
type
system
has
a
number
of
features
which
all
exist
in
other
languages
,
but
are
rarely
combined
within
a
single
,
consistent
language
:

it
is
a
sound
,
static
type
system
,
meaning
that
a
number
of
errors
are
guaranteed
not
to
happen
at
runtime
without
needing
runtime
type
checks
(
this
is
also
the
case
in
Caml
,
SML
and
almost
the
case
in
Java
,
but
not
in
,
say
,
Lisp
,
Python
,
C
,
or
C++
)
;

it
peforms
static
type
reconstruction
,
meaning
that
the
programmer
does
n't
need
to
write
types
unless
he
wants
to
,
the
compiler
will
reconstruct
them
on
its
own
(
this
is
also
the
case
in
Caml
and
SML
,
but
not
in
Java
or
C
)
;

it
supports
impredicative
polymorphism
(
type
variables
)
,
even
at
higher
kinds
(
unlike
Caml
and
SML
,
or
any
other
production-ready
language
known
to
me
)
;

it
has
good
support
for
overloading
(
type
classes
)
(
unlike
Caml
and
SML
)
.

Whether
any
of
those
make
Haskell
a
better
language
is
open
to
discussion
—
for
example
,
while
I
happen
to
like
type
classes
a
lot
,
I
know
quite
a
few
Caml
programmers
who
strongly
dislike
overloading
and
prefer
to
use
the
module
system
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
Haskell
type
system
lacks
a
few
features
that
other
languages
support
elegantly
:

it
has
no
support
for
runtime
dispatch
(
unlike
Java
,
Lisp
,
and
Julia
)
;

it
has
no
support
for
existential
types
and
GADTs
(
these
are
both
GHC
extensions
)
;

it
has
no
support
for
dependent
types
(
unlike
Coq
,
Agda
and
Idris
)
.

Again
,
whether
any
of
these
are
desirable
features
in
a
general-purpose
programming
language
is
open
to
discussion
.

One
major
difference
between
Haskell
's
type
system
and
that
of
most
OO
languages
is
that
the
ability
for
a
function
to
have
side
effects
is
represented
by
a
data
type
(
a
monad
such
as
IO
)
.

This
allows
you
to
write
pure
functions
that
the
compiler
can
verify
are
side-effect-free
and
referentially
transparent
,
which
generally
means
that
they
're
easier
to
understand
and
less
prone
to
bugs
.

It
's
possible
to
write
side-effect-free
code
in
other
languages
,
but
you
do
n't
have
the
compiler
's
help
in
doing
so
.

Haskell
makes
you
think
more
carefully
about
which
parts
of
your
program
need
to
have
side
effects
(
such
as
I/O
or
mutable
variables
)
and
which
parts
should
be
pure
.

Also
,
although
it
's
not
quite
part
of
the
type
system
itself
,
the
fact
that
function
definitions
in
Haskell
are
expressions
(
rather
than
lists
of
statements
)
means
that
more
of
the
code
is
subject
to
type-checking
.

In
languages
like
C++
and
Java
,
it
's
often
possible
to
introduce
logic
errors
by
writing
statements
in
the
wrong
order
,
since
the
compiler
does
n't
have
a
way
to
determine
that
one
statement
must
precede
another
.

For
example
,
you
might
have
one
line
that
modifies
an
object
's
state
,
and
another
line
that
does
something
important
based
on
that
state
,
and
it
's
up
to
you
to
ensure
that
these
things
happen
in
the
correct
order
.

In
Haskell
,
this
kind
of

I
tried
to
set
closed
captions
for
my
own
video
and
got
the
same
result
.

I
believe
that
in
the
player
,
the
"
CC
"
you
see
is
actually
referring
to
subtitles
.

There
's
an
important
distinction
between
subtitles
and
closed
captioning
(
see
here
and
here
)
.

Therefore
,
I
believe
isCC
will
only
be
true
for
videos
that
include
this
kind
of
captioning
intended
for
people
who
might
not
be
able
to
hear
what
's
happening
in
the
video
,
as
opposed
to
just
general
captions
that
people
can
put
onto
their
videos
.

I
think
that
in
almost
all
cases
,
only
high
quality
,
paid
movies
on
YouTube
will
have
these
kinds
of
captions
.

In
that
sense
,
the
isCC
property
works
the
way
it
's
supposed
to
.

I
am
learning
Collection
Framework
on
this
website
:
http://way2java.com/collections/hashtable-about/
.

After
reading
all
the
methods
of
Hashtable
I
see
two
methods
to
access
the
table
's
keys
:

Set
keys()
:
Returns
a
Set
object
containing
all
the
keys

Set
keySet()
:
Returns
a
Set
object
containing
all
the
keys
of
Hashtable
.

One
similarity
is
Hashtable
and
Set
does
not
allow
duplicates
.

Adding
and
removing
elements
in
Set
also
reflects
in
Hashtable

Both
of
them
return
a
Set
object
.

I
do
n't
see
the
different
between
them
.

Anyone
can
tell

about
this
?

keys()
does
n't
return
a
Set
,
it
returns
an
Enumeration<K>
.

Hashtable
is
a
very
legacy
class
no
longer
recommended
for
use
.

It
is
replaced
by
HashMap
,
or
ConcurrentHashMap
†
.

It
existed
before
the
JCF
did
,
therefore
the
standard
way
to
get
to
the
keys
at
the
start
was
through
an
Enumeration
-
the
original
Java
interface
for
moving
through
a
collection
of
objects
.

Then
came
Java
1.2
,
and
the
JCF
.

Hashtable
was
retrofitted
for
the
Map
interface
with
the
keySet()
method
that
returned
a
Set
(
also
introduced
with
the
JCF
)
.

The
keys
method
was
retained
for
legacy
compatibility
reasons
.

The
Set
returned
from
the
new
method
achieves
two
things
:

conveys
intent
-
it
reinforces
the
fact
that
the
keys
of
a
Hashtable
are
a
mathematical
set

implements
Iterable
<T>,
which
replaces
Enumerable<T>

This
has
probably
been
answered
elsewhere
,
but
since
this
question
pops
up
when
searching
google
for
actionwebservice
and
get
requests
,
I
thought
I
would
answer
it
here
.

By
default
AWS
refuses
non-POST
requests
.

Specifically
it
has
code
in
action_controller_dispatcher.rb
that
reads
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_423
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Basically
you
have
to
either
set
up
the
request
to
POST
the
request
instead
of
GETting
it
.

Or
you
have
to
override
AWS
's
handling
of
GET
requests
.

(
You
might
try
editing
the
code
inside
the
gem
,
but
(
1)
that
will
get
overwritten
when
you
update
the
gem
and
(
2)
I
'm
not
sure
how
good
an
idea
that
is
in
general
and
(
3)
I
've
never
tried
it
.

The
former
is
likely
more
appropriate
if
you
have
control
of
the
code
generating
the
request
.

If
you
do
n't
,
Zack
Chandler
had
a
workaround
(
for
QuickBooks
's

to
a

,
but
it

.

I

Obviously
the

get
the

Edited
to
provide
a
solution
that
's
fast
for
much
larger
strings
:

If
you
have
a
very
long
string
(
on
the
order
of
millions
of
nucleotides
)
,
the
lookbehind
assertion
in
my
original
answer
(
below
)
is
too
slow
to
be
practical
.

In
that
case
,
use
something
more
like
the
following
,
which
:
(
1)
splits
the
string
apart
between
every
character
;
(
2)
uses
the
characters
to
fill
up
a
three
row
matrix
;
and
then
(
3)
extracts
the
characters
in
the
3rd
row
of
the
matrix
.

This
takes
on
the
order
of
0.2
seconds
to
process
a
3-million
character
long
string

show

do
n't

you
need
to
precise
layout

'

There

several
things
you
need
to
do
to
fix
up
that
code
:

1)
'
Maps

has
no
layout
.

Since
it
has
a
single
child
item
,
layout
:
'
fit
'
would
be
appropriate
here
.

2)
Only
use
fullscreen
on
the
outermost
item
,
you
do
n't
want
the
other
items
to
be
fullscreen
since
they
are
child
items
of
other
containers
.

3)
To
dynamically
add
items
to
a
container
,
use
the
add()
method
on
container
.

You
'll
also
need
to
call
doLayout()
to
trigger
a

for
the
container
.

However

in

I
do

you

adding
the

it
does
n't
give
you
any

Instead
,
I
would
add
the
map
directly
to
the

.

4)
The
btnPanel
has
no
layout
either
,
so
you
'll
need
to
choose
an

there
as
well
,
possibly

Yes
,
no

with
this
!

The
number
of
shards
does
n't
limit
the
number
of
consumers
a
stream
can
have
.

In
you
case
,
it
will
just
limit
the
number
of
concurrent
invocations
of
each
lambda
.

This
means
that
for
each

,
you
can
only
have
the

of

of
concurrent
executions

No
,
you
have
to
add
the
column
first
.

Schema-less
databases
(
NoSQL
)
can
support
this
,
but
an
RDBMS
needs
to
have
its
scheme
altered
.

You
asked
kind
of
an
involved
question
,
especially
without
being
able
to
see
your
server
side
code
.

Since
you
mentioned
needing
source
code
,
here
is
the
official
Android
Developers
training
with
source
code
examples
,
http://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops/connecting.html

I
'll

the
relevant

in
here
,

CODE_BLOCK

Having
done
this
a
few
times
,
though
,
I
'd
like
to
point
out
some
things
that
will
likely
bite
you
when
you
try
to
implement
this

Android
requires
you
to
do
anything
that
calls
a
web
server
in
a
background
thread
.

http://developer.android.com/training/multiple-threads/index.html

You
are
probably
going
to
need
some
kind
of
authentication
,
especially
if
PHP
side
you
used
e.g
.
Drupal
.

I
would
find
out
if
your
PHP
framework
requires
e.g
.
Session
auth
with
a
CRLF
token
or
OAuth
or
a
similar
scheme
.

Authentication
will
involve
three
steps
:

**
Sign
in

**
Retrieve
a
cookie
or
token

**
Send
the
token
in
along
with
your
content
in
your
headers

Finally
you
are
going
to
need
some
sort
of
data
encapsulation
layer
.

I
like
JSON
,
some
folks
like
XML
.

The
GSON
library
,
which
you
can
learn
more
about
here
,
https://google-gson.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gson/docs/javadocs/com/google/gson/Gson.html
,
is
the
most
user
and
beginner
friendly
JSON
library
I
know
of
.

In
practice
I
usually
use
Android
's
built-in
JSONArray
and
JSONObject
though
.

The

to
an

When

sometimes
referred

using
the
notation
{}foo
and
sometimes
(
as
in

using
the

The

telling

at

NO

There

out

Azure
.

Question
is
how
it
(
the
certificate
)
appeared
in

at
first
place
.

It
was
certainly
not
uploaded
by
Microsoft

some

It
is
a
developer
who
packed
the

package
to
include
the
certificate
reference
(
thumbprint
)
and
service
administrator
(
or
co-admin
)
who
uploaded
the
original
certificate
in
the
Azure
.

So
contact
that
people
(
whom
might
be
just
you
?
)

and
ask
for
the
original
certificate
.

If
certificate
is
lost
,
contact
the
original
issuer
(
certification
authority
)
for
a
copy
,
if
you
were
the
one
to

originally

If

know
your

can
afford
to
keep
a

of
primes
,
then
factoring
them
may

a

for
the
average/random
case

Otherwise
,
worst
case
complexity
,
it
's
still
O(N*N)
-
think
"
all
of
them
are
primes
"
for
the
worst
case
.

Approach
:

factor
them
and
store
a
Map[N]
+
int
closestNeigh[]

take
a
factor
and
O(N)
determine
for
each
of
them
the
closest
that
contain
that
factor
(
prefix/sufix
sums
will
be

eliminate
that
factor
from
all
the
factor
maps

take
the
next
factor
.

Adjust
the
closest
neighbor
index
only
if
new
one
is
closest
.

This
may
bring
some

The

In

When
you
save
the
file
in
Notepad
,
the
file
is
reencoded
to
be
saved
as
your
default
file
encoding
for
your
Windows
installation
.

Notepad
auto-detected
the
encoding
when
it
opened
the
file
,
however
.

Python
opens
file
using
that
same
system
encoding
,
by
default
,
which
is
why
you
can
now
open
the
file
.

Quoting
the
open()
function
documentation
:

OP_BLOCK
:
(

You
'll
have
to
explicitly
specify

for

if
you
wanted
to
open
it
directly
in
Python
:

CODE_BLOCK

A_3408

I
used
'
utf-8-sig
'
as
an
example
here
,
as
that
is
a
file
encoding
that
Notepad
can
auto-detect
.

It
could
well
be
that
the
encoding
is
UTF-16
or
plain
UTF-8
or
any
number
of
other
encodings
,
however
.

If
you
think
that
the
page
is
encoded
with
a
specific
ANSI
codepage
you
still
have
to
name
the
exact
codepage
.

Your
system
is
configured
to
use
code
page
936
(
GBK
)
but
that
is
not
the
correct
encoding
for
this

.

I

working
on
an
MVC5
application

I
am
having
a
problem
getting
the
server-side
validation
of
number
fields
to
work
for
the
specific
culture
(
de-CH
)
.

It
really
feels
like
it
is
defaulting
to
the
standard
German
format
.

I
have
set
the
web.config
globalization
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_2609
(
code
omitted

I
am
not
using
any
resource
files
,
so
from
what
I
understand
the
uiCulture
does
not
come
into
play
.

The
client
is
using
jquery.globalize
and
correctly
loading
and
using
the
de-CH
culture
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_2610
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

reports
the
proper
culture
of
'
de-CH
'
on
both
machines
.

Locally
it
validates
100.00
as
correct
,
but
on
the
server
it
says
that
is
not
a
number
.

All
of
this
works
properly
on
my
local
Win7
IIS7
instance
.

Though
when
we
install
it
on
the
client
Win8
server
it
does
not
work
anymore
.

The
client-side
is
validating
numbers
properly
for
the
de-CH
culture
'
0.00
'
,
but
the
server
rejects
them
as
invalid
.

The
Date
formats
ARE
however
working
,
which
just
adds
to
the
confusion
.

This
is
where
I
wonder
if
it
is
somehow
falling
back
to
de-DE
where
the
date
formats
are
the
same
but
the
number
format
is
'
0
,
00
'
.

Does
a
server
have
to
have
a
specific
culture
enabled/installed
?

Or
any
other
ideas
to
check
?

I
need
to
somehow
extract
plain
HTTP
request
message
from
a
Request
object
in
Scrapy
(
so
that
I
could
,
for
example
,
copy/paste
this
request
and
run
from
Burp
)
.

So
given
a
scrapy.http.Request
object
,
I
would
like
to
get
the
corresponding
request
message
,
such
as
e.g
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_5581
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Clearly
I
have
all
the
information
I
need
in
the
Request
object
,
however
trying
to
reconstruct
the
message
manually
is
error-prone
as
I
could
miss
some
edge
cases
.

My
understanding
is
that
Scrapy
first
converts
this
Request
into
Twisted
object
,
which
then
writes
headers
and
body
into
a
TCP
transport
.

So
maybe
there
's
away
to
do
something
similar
,
but
write
to
a
string
instead
?

UPDATE

I
could
use
the
following
code
to
get
HTTP
1.0
request
message
,
which
is
based
on
http.py
.

Is
there
a
way
to
do
something
similar
with
HTTP
1.1
requests
/
http11.py
,
which
is
what
's
actually
being
sent
?

I
would
obviously
like
to
avoid
duplicating
code
from
Scrapy/Twisted
frameworks
as
much
as
possible
.

As
scrapy
is
open
source
and
also
has
plenty
of
extension
points
,
this
should
be
doable
.

The
requests
are
finally
assembled
and
sent
out
in
scrapy/core/downloader/handlers/http11.py
in
ScrapyAgent.download_request
(
https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/core/downloader/handlers/http11.py#L270
)

If
you
place
your
hook
there
you
can
dump
the
request
type
,
request
headers
,
and
request
body
.

To
place
your
code
there
you
can
either
try
monkey
patching
ScrapyAgent.download_request
or
to
subclass
ScrapyAgent
to
do
the
request
logging
,
then
subclass
HTTP11DownloadHandler
to
use
your
Scrapy
Agent
and
then
set
HTTP11DownloadHandler
as
new
DOWNLOAD_HANDLER
for
http
/
https
requests
in
your
project
's
settings.py
(
for
details
see
:
https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#download-handlers
)

In
my
opinion
this
is
the
closest
you
can
get
to
logging
the
requests
going
out
without
using
a
packet
sniffer
or
a
logging
proxy
(
which
might
be
a
bit
overkill
for
your
scenario

I
am
attempting
to
up-sample
an
icosahedron
in
MATLAB
by
adding
new
vertices
at
the
mid-points
of
each
edge
and
recomputing
the
faces
.

I
've
managed
to
place
the
new
vertices
,
but
I
ca
n't
figure
out
how
to
recompute
the
new
faces
.

I
want
each
vertex
to
connect
to
its
closest
neighbours
to
form
a
new
,
up-sampled
icosahedron

For
a
triangle
{
1
,
2
,
3}
,
subdividing
will
create
3
new
vertices
{
a
,
b
,
c}
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_7127
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

It
will
also
create
4
new
faces
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_7128
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Your
code
creates
the
coordinates
of
the
new
vertices
in
V
such
that
the
a
vertices
for
all
of
the
triangles
come
first
,
followed
by
the
c
vertices
,
and
then
the
b
vertices
.

First
let
's
generate
the
indices
of
these
vertices
.

The
new
indices
start
from
size(S.vertices)+1
and
there
are
a
total
of
3*size(S.faces)
of
them
.

Let
's
also
group
the
new
vertices
for
a
each
existing
face
together
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_7129
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
gives
us
all
of
the
new
[
a
b
c
]
faces
(
actually
,
in
[
a
c
b
]
order
)
in
Vx(f,:)
with
the
a
vertices
in
Vx(:,1)
,
the
b
vertices
in
Vx(:,3)<-
-
not
2
!
,
and
the
c
vertices
in
Vx(:,2)
.

Now
we
need
to
create
the
other
3
new
faces
for
each
existing
face
.

You
can
do
this
using
cat
,
permute
and
reshape
,
but
it
gets
really
ugly
and
incomprehensible
.

Since
we
've
only
got
9
vertices
that
go
into
these
faces
,
it
's
easier
to
just
plug
them
in
manually
to
create
a
m
x
9
matrix
and
then
reshape
into
m*3
x
3

Let

that
some
of
the
code

general
enough
to

extracted
out

a
gem

So
you
create
a

project
,
build
the
gem
,
publish
it
to
Rubygems
,
and
then
reference
it
in
your

Then
you
discover
a
small
bug
with
how
the
gem
interacts
with
your
product
.

Each
time
your
make
a
fix
,
building
and
installing
the
gem
locally
can
take
about
15
seconds
.

How
do
you
minimise
this
to
have
a

cycle

(

gem
's
version
number
could
contradict
with
what
you
've

to
Rubygems
,
leading
to
confusion

As
noted
in
the
comments
:
Once
something
has
been
sent
to
the
browser
(
or
any
other
output
)
,
it
is
impossible
to
change
it
server-side
.

The
best
solution
,
if
you
are
able
to
edit
the
contents
of
the
header
with
preg_replace()
etc
,
is
to
simply
set
the
variable
before
including
the
header
.

So
that
instead
of
something
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5718
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

You
move
all
of
the
processing
before
you
start
to
output
anything
to
the
browser
,
which
completely
eliminates
the
paradox
of
having
to
change
something
you
've
already
sent
.

Which
should
leave
you
with
a
code
looking
something
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5719
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

It
also
has
the
added
benefit
of
making
your
PHP
code
much
simpler
to
read
,
and
thus
easier
to
maintain
in
the
long
run
.

Even
on
this
small
code
sample
,
you
can
see
the
difference
a
proper
seperation
of
concerns
does
.

This
is
a
multi
threaded
scenario
.

The
main
thread
handles
the
application
and
UI
events
,
and
it
starts
up
a
new
thread
to
do
some
background
operations
.

The
"
background
"
thread
loads
the
data
from
files
into
a
data-table
of
a
strongly-typed
dataset
.

The
DataGridView
is
bound
to
that
DataTable
.

Once
the
data
is
ready
,
the
"
background
"
thread
invokes
the
refresh()
function
of
the
DataGridView
on
the
form
.

If
there
are
more
lines
then
what
fits
on
one
screen
and
the
vertical
scrollbar
is
to
appear
:
the
grid
crashes
.

The
new
datalines
are
always
displayed
.

Error
only
occurs
if
there
are
enough
lines
to
display
the
scrollbar
(
see
image
below
)
.

I
use
.NET
3.5
.

In
Windows
XP
it
crashes
the
whole
application
.

On
Win
7
(
64
bit
)
only
the
grid
becomes
unresponsive
,
but
once
I
resize
the
window
the
scrollbar
appears
and
all
is
fine
.

The
relevant
parts
of
the

are

difference
is
the
databinding
,
it
looks
like
:

And
I
update
the
dataTable
in
a
similar
way
,
but
from
another
thread
.

But
the
new
data
lines
do
not
appear
until
I
,
say
,
resize
the

Which
raises
the
question
how
I
can
properly
update
the
dataTable
from
another
thread
?

Answer_to_Question_ID

Question_URL

I
'm
guessing
the
problem
has
to
do
with
how
WinForms
works
inside
the
STA
model
for
threading
.

Basically
,
the
DataTable
you
're
accessing
is
located
somewhere
,
and
that
is
probably
inside
the
form
we
see
above
.

So
,
when
you
update
the
DataTable
from
another
thread
,
which
thread
gets
the
events
needed
for
binding
?

Likely
the
thread
you
update
it
from
,
and
the
form
's
thread
is
not
aware
of
the
changes
being
made
.

So
,
you
simply
need
to
invoke
any
calls
to
DataTable
onto
the
form
itself
,
so
it
receives
the
events
properly
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_683
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

It
seems
backwards
,
but
keep
in
mind
in
an
"
enterprise
"
situation
,
you
'd
probably
be
accessing
that
dataset
by
multiple
adapters
.

So
,
your
update
thread
would
have
an
adapter
to
itself
,
and
your
GUI
would
have
its
own
also
.

The
other
solution
would
be
to
use
a
BindingList
,
which
I
believe
has
thread
compatibility
for
this
type
of
situation
,
but
do
n't
quote
me
on
that
.

For
extra
credit
,
this
could
also
explain
your
problem
before
with
crashing
.

By
accessing
the
DataGridView
from
the
background
thread
,
you
had
cross-thread
operations
going
on
.

I
would
n't
call
:

These
will
take
progressively
longer
and
longer
as
the
data
set
gets
larger
and
larger
.

I
've
written
an

I
set
the
DataSource
of
the

to
a

:

CODE_BLOCK

then
simply
add

to

This

You
have
n't
said
which
line
is
throwing
the
error
,
but
I
noticed
that
you
do
n't
seem
to
have
instantiated
a
new
FileSystemObject
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6961
(

then
use
the
fso
reference
to
copy
your
file

CODE_BLOCK

A_6962
(

The
method
above
used
"
Late

"
to
interrogate
the
registry
for
Scripting.FileSystemObject

You
can
also
use
early
binding
and
reference
the
Microsoft
Scripting
Runtime
directly
and
avoid
the
use
of
CreateObject

I

I
tried

In
a
shared
spreadsheet
to
prevents
any
other
user
but
myself
from
adding
,
deleting
or
updating
a
column
you
do
n't
need
a
script
.

When
you
say
prevent
them
updating
a
column
that
implies
you
do
n't
want
them
to
have
write
access
.

Either
this
is
to
a
particular
column
or
to
any
column
.

You
can
set
protection
to
one
of
view
only
,
comment
only
to
;

the
entire
spreadsheet

individual
sheets
or

areas
within
a
sheet

If
you
do
any
of
these
they
will
not
be
able
to
delete
the
column
either
.

Reading
your
code
,
the
line
;

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3482
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Implies
you
want
to
check
if
they
have
modified
your
sheet
on
a
row
basis
.

To
prevent
them
inserting
or
deleting
a
row
,

create
a
blank
column

protect
the
column
from
editing

hide
the
column

If
anyone
tries
to
add
or
delete
a
row
,
this
will
span
the
hidden
protected
column
and
they
will
get
an
error
message
telling
them
this
.

Now
the
only
onEdit(e)
you
will
detect
with
be
the
editing
of
a
cell
or
group
of
cells
.

Note
that
adding/deleting
rows
will
not
trigger
onEdit()
,
they
will
trigger
onChange()
.

Within
this
there
is
specific
way
to
tell
whether
a
row
has
been
deleted
or
inserted
.

onEdit(e)
will
allow
you
to
look
at
the
range
that
has
been
affected
,
you
can
cross
check
this
with
your
spreadsheets
parameters

I
have
a
working
code
with
a
Datagrid
as
the
main

.

I
used
a
Datagrid
as
it
is
very
easy
to
bind
data
into
it
.

My
code
requires
moving
cells
into
other
columns
so
I
always
need
to
check
which
cell
I
am
on
when
the
mouse
is
clicked
,
as
well
as
when
it
is
released
.

My
current
implementation
is
working
as
expected
.

However
,
the
way
I
check
for
the
row
and
cell
is
through
the
VIEW
's
code-behind
.

My
project
leader
is
looking

an
alternative
to
have
this
done
thru
binding
as
he
wants

I

Alternative
would
be
to
work
with
properties
DataGrid
already
provides
to
you
and/or
to
define
few
other
attached
properties
supporting
you
to
get
the
job
done
.

I
would
try
to
work
with
properties
like
SelectedItem
,
SelectedValue
,
CurrentItem
,
CurrentCell
.

Futhermore
if
a
behavior
couldnt
be
handled
with
those
properties
from
above
I
would
create
an
attached
property
and
use
a
style
for
cells
with
triggers
changing
the
attached
property
.

Binding
will
transmit
all
the
changes
from
the
attached
property
to
the
ViewModel
.

In
the
end
you
will
have
just
communication
between
ViewModel
and
View
.

The
general
way
to
achieve
your
requirement
is
to
implement
an
ICommand
type
Attached
Property
for
each
event
that
you
want
to
replace
.

The
basic
idea
is
this.
.
add
an
ICommand
Attached
Property
with
a
PropertyChangedCallback
handler
.

In
this
handler
(
which
will
be
called
when
an
ICommand
is
data
bound
to
this
property
)
,
attach
a
handler
to
the
event
that
you
want
to
handle
.

Then
,
when
that
event
is
called
,
just
execute
the
ICommand
instance
.

So
you
can
handle
the
event
in
your
view
model
via
the
ICommand
instance
.

event

You

\Exceptions\Handler.php
to
not
have
the

handle
some
logic
within

convert
the

In
my
users
controller
I
am
trying
to
put
in
place
the
remember
me
functionality
on
login
.

IT
seems
pretty
simple
set
a
cookie
look
for
the
cookie
when
the
user
visits
the
login
page
and
if
it
exists
log
them
in
.

However
,
Cake
is
not
saving
the
cookie
,
at
least
not
that
I
can
see
,
and
when
I
revisit
the
page
I
am
not
auto
logged
in
.

To
test
this
I
have
the
following
code
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_741
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Now
right
after
I
set
this
cookie
I
can
place
a
$this->cookie->read('Auth.User')
;
and
get
the
value
of
this
cookie
,
however
it
does
not
show
up
in
the
browsers
(
Chrome
,
FireFox
)
cookie
list
.

If
I
use
plain
PHP
cookies
,
via
setcookie()
I
can
see
the
cookie
but
of
course
the
Cake
Cookie
read
does
not
work
with
those
cookies
.

What
should
I
look
for
to
resolve
this
issue
?

I
did
find
a
work
around
,
but
I
do
n't
like
it
because
it
just
bypasses
the
framework
.

I
found
out
how
cake
is
creating
the
cookies
and
for
these
cookies
I
use
cakes
cookie
creation
algorithm
in
my
code
and
use
setcookie()
to
do
the
setting
.

Just
for
anyone
else
that
may
want
or
need
to
use
the
work
around
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_742
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Now
you
can
use
cakes
cookie
component
to
read
the
value
.

There
is
more
you
have
to
change
if
your
value
is
an
array
,
read
through
the
cookie.php
code
to
see
what
you
would
need
to
do
.

Also
I
left
out
the
encryption
that
too
can
be
found
in
the
cookie.php
and
your
apps
settings
.

For
this
issue
I
do
not
need
array
values
since
I
am
only
store
the
users
ID
.

and
I
did
put
in
place
encryption
unlike
above
.

I
would
still
like
to
know
why
the
component
is
not
working
though
.

This

These

The

,
and
some

using

expect
this

For

,
Jackson
mapper
can
serialize

;
if

that
some

Matplotlib
"
snaps
"
plot
limits

"
whole
"
(
factors
of
2
,
5
,
10
,
100
,
etc
)
numbers
,
by
default
.

This
often
means
that
your
data
may
wind
up
on
the
boundary
of
the
plot
.

ax.margins
allows
you
to
add
a
padding
factor
before
this
autoscaling
for
the
plot
is
calculated
.

It
's
a
quick
way
to
avoid
the
problem
of
points
on
the

boundary
.

Remove

remove

remove

Let
me
commence
by
stating
my
objective
:
I
am
attempting
to
compare
two
13-bit
integers
:
>
,
<
,
and
=
;
I
have
to
do
this
calculation
trillions
of
times
,
so
it
is
imperative
that
I
optimize
it
as
much
as
possible
.

My
program
currently
utilizes
Python
2.7
and
pyopencl
to
achieve
this
calculation
.

I
am
averaging
about
800
GFlops
out
of
my
ATI
Radeon
6870
which
is
fine
for
now
.

So
here
is
my
question
:
If
instead
of
caring
out
the
<,
>,
and
=
operators
on
4
byte
floats
(as
I
am
doing
now),
I
wrote
bitwise
functions
to
handle
the
<,
>
,
and
=
,
and
I
was
able
to
process
2
-
13
bits
objects
at
a
time
,
would
this
increase
my
speed
?

Or
does
C
already
have
the
most
efficient
way
of
finding
<,
and
>
,
and
=
(
obviously
)
for
floats
?

I
'm
assuming
the

If

look

I
would
like
my
page
to
pop-up
a
window
that
contains
a
form
.

When
the
form
is
filled
out
and
Submit
is
clicked
,
I
would
like
the
pop-up
to
remain
on
top
of
the
page
with
new
data
loaded
into
it
.

Whenever
I
try
this
so
far
,
when
I
click
on
the
submit
button
in
my
pop-up
,
the
pop-up
either
closes
,
if
I
have
target
=
"
_self
"
,
or
the
contains
of
the
pop-up
go
into
a
new
tab
that
the
browser
opens
.

I
have
yet
to
find
a
solution
that
allows
the
pop-up
to
stay
up
when
coming
from
this
AJAX
pop-up
function
(
listed
below
)
.

I
could
do
a
standard
non-AJAX
popup
,
but
then
if
a
user
clicks
on
the
page
the
pop-up
came
from
,
the
pop-up
goes
underneath
the
main
page
,
which
is
n't
something
I
want
at
all
.

Here
is
the
page
where
my
pop-up
comes
from

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_4221
(
code

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_4222
(

So
,
this
is
the
current
graph
and
form
pop-up
.

It
is
in
the
form
of
a
JSP
backed
by
a
servlet
.

The
first
part
of
the
header
gets
all
the
parameters
and
then
zoomPlot.generatePlot()
creates
the
plot
and
saves
it
as
a
.png
.

The
body
displays
the
.png
graph
and
then
also
shows
the
form
.

When
one
submits
the
form
,
the
same
thing
happens
again
.

The
first
time
,
this
pop-up
is
displayed
,
the
plot
uses
default
values
.

I
'm
not
really
sure
how
to
convert
this
to
an
AJAX
request
,
so
if
anyone
has
any
good
ideas
,
please
let
me
know
.

I
'd
like
to
recycle

much
as
I
can

There
are
many
ways
I
would
do
it
:

1
:
A
form
and
an
Iframe

Target
the
form
to
the
iframe
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4931
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Visually
hide
the
iframe
with
CSS
on
initial
load
.

You
should
visibility
:
hidden
;
instead
of
display
:
none
;
because
the
latter
destroys
an
element
from
the
DOM
.

Prevent
default
submission
of
the
form
.

When
the
form
is
submitted
(
with
AJAX
)
,
hide
the
form
and
show
the
iframe
.

The
dialog
would
still
be
open
.

2
:
A
form
with
AJAX

Wrap
the
form
in
a
div
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4932
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Then
use
AJAX
to
submit
the
form
and
show
results
in
the
#results
-container

NOTE
:

I
'm
trying
to
explain
the
process
so
that
you
'll
be
able
to
implement
your
own
login
.

DO
NOT
FORGET
to
prevent
default
submission
of
the
form
in
any
of
the
above
examples
!

Since
you
use
jQuery
,
it
's
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4933
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

PS
:
Your
snippet
is
not
functioning
properly
.

:::EDIT::
:

Prevent
default
submission
of
the
form

Send
a
POST
request
on
submit
to
your
server

Respond
with
the
new
graph
image
url
from
the
server

Replace
the
old

image
src
with
the

one

I

I
've
fixed
this
error
by
building
the
project
with
the
following
commands
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2730
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
first
command
tells
to
use
the
Android
2.3.3
toolchain
for
buiding
the
project
.

Note
that
I
still
have
android:minSdkVersion
=
"
8
"
in
AndroidManifest.xml
.

You
should
not
delete
the
values-v9/
folder
.

Removing
it
can
cause
displaying

If

you
have
to
remove

Avoid

In
our
application
we
have
a
few
GDI+
objects
that
are
used
often
in
many
different
contexts
.

This
includes
some
instances
of
Font
,
SolidBrush
(
White
,
Black.
.
)
,
some
Pen.
.

For
those
objects
our
strategy
so
far
has
been
to
hold
them
through
widely
visible
static
read-only
fields
.

This
avoids
to
create/dispose
them
millions
of
time
.

We
took
care
of
thread-safety
accesses
on
these
object
of
course
(
they
are
just
accessed
from
the
UI
thread
basically
)
.

There
are
just
a
few
of
these
GDI+
objects
hold
for
the
lifetime
of
the
application
,
say
like
200
.

The
others
GDI+
objects
(
the
ones
with
short-life
)
are
all
disposed
asap
.

But
we
sometime
get
unexpected
GDI+
resources
outage
exception
,
hopefully
rarely
enough
.

I
am
wondering
if
these
exceptions
could
come
from
these
few
GDI+
objects
hold
,
and
if
this
would
be
a
wiser
strategy
to
create/dispose
tons
of
short-life
GDI+
objects
instead
.

Does
anybody
have
real-world
experience
and
relevant
conclusions
about
theses
two
strategies
?

Caching
System.Drawing
objects
is
a
mistake
.

They
are
very
cheap
to
create
,
very
expensive
to
keep
around
.

They
are
allocated
on
a
special
heap
that
all
processes
on
a
desktop
need
to
share
.

The
heap
size
is
limited
to
65535
objects
.

Creating
objects
like
a
brush
or
a
pen
takes
roughly
a
microsecond
,
miniscule
compared
to
the
cost
of
the
operation
you
perform
with
them
.

The
only
drawing
object
that
is
expensive
is
a
Font
.

Creating
one
involves
a
sizable
chunk
of
overhead
taken
by
the
font
mapper
.

But
that
's
already
solved
by
.NET
,
it
caches
them
.

Other
than
hogging
the
heap
needlessly
,
the
programming
style
is
dangerous
.

It
is
far
too
easy
to
forget
blindly
applying
the
using
statement
.

This
certainly
can
get
you
into
trouble
,
you
are
relying
on
the
finalizer
thread
to
release
them
again
.

If
a
program
involves
lots
of
heavy
painting
but
not
enough
object
allocation
to
trigger
a
GC
then
you
will
exhaust
the
quota
for
GDI
objects
.

Which
is
10,000
objects
for
a
process
by
default
.

This
will
crash
your
program
.

Do
note
that
the
System.Drawing
class
wrappers
are
not
nearly
big
enough
to
trigger
a
GC
by
themselves
,
10000
of
them
will
not
be
enough
to
get
the
finalizers
to
run
and
release
the
handles
again
.

The
problem
is
very
easy
to
diagnose
,
you
can
use
Task
Manager
.

Use
View
+
Select
Columns
and
tick
"
GDI
Objects
"
.

Might
as
well
tick
"
USER
Objects
"
,
another
one
that
's
very
easily
leaked
.

Keep
an
eye
on
the
displayed
counts
for
your
process
while
you
are
using
it
.

A
steadily
climbing
number
spells
doom

When

However

if

Other

If
your
interface
also
has
reasonable
default
behavior
for
at
least
some
of
the
functionality
,
you
may
want
to
use
an
abstract
class
to
avoid
common
boilerplate
code
in
all
of
the
concrete
implementations
.

Otherwise
,
use
an
interface
.

Answer_to_Question_ID

I
find
the
best
option
most
of
the
time
is
to
do
both
.

That
is
not
always
possible
when
you
are
relying
on
something
happening
in
the
base
class
.

Providing
both
an
abstract
base
class
and
an
interface
allows
the
greatest
latitude
by
implementers
of
your
abstraction
,
again
,
as
long
as
you
do
n't
require
something
happens
by
an
implementer
of
the
interface
.

If
you
require
that
something
happens
,
then
you
do
n't
want
to
provide
an
interface
at
all--and
you
would
also
need
to
make
sure
that
your
base
class
ensures
this
required
action
to
ALWAYS
occur
..
.

Negative
to
doing
both
:
more
goo
.

example
pseudocode
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_209
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Note
that
in
this
example
,
someone
could
make
their
own
class
that
implements
IVehicle
and
then
pass
it
to
anything
that
takes
an
IVehicle
.

That
object
would
NOT
need
to
be
a
child
of
the
Vehicle
abstract
class
.

If
,
therefore
,
you
were
to
expect
something
specific
to
happen
in
the
PutCarInGear()
method
,
it
's
quite
likely
that
that
new

As
someone
who
is
quite
new
to
Swift
and
CoreData
,
I
am
sure
I
am
going
about
this
the
wrong
way
and
am
hoping
someone
might
be
able
to
help
.

Background
:
I
am
downloading
JSON
over
an
API
,
and
caching
the
content
locally
on
an
iPad
in
CoreData
.

As
part

I
need
to
download
a
small
image
thumbnail
,
which
I
am
also
storing
in
CoreData
(
as
a
Transformable
)
.

I
was
doing
:
My
original
implementation
downloaded
images
and
saved
them
to
CoreData
,
but
although
it
is
being
triggered
from
a
background
thread
(
a
callback
following
the
API
call
)
,
the
actual
downloading
of
the
images
seems
to
cause
the
app
to
hang
:

What
I
am

doing

I
have
since
updated
my
code
to
the
following
:

CODE_BLOCK

I
then
call
the
code
thus
:

CODE_BLOCK

Doing
this
,
I
do
n't
get
any
blocks
on
the

thread
that
I
notice
.

Inspecting
the
sqlite
file
from
the
device
,
it
looks
as
though
the
data
is
getting
set
properly
,
but
the
images
are
not
showing
up
in
the
UI
.

Is
my
method
completely
wrong
?

If
not
,
how
can
I
inform
the
UI
that
the
core
data
model
has
been
updated
in
such
a
way
that
will
cause
a
refresh
?

What
function
can
be
called
to
update
a
specific
row/cell

a

Your
NSURLConnection
's
callbacks
are
happening
on
the
main
queue
.

This
is
one
reason
your
application
is
locking
up
.

Your
managed
object
context
,
at
least
in
the
code
you
have
posted
,
is
not
following
the
Core
Data
concurrency
rules
.

You
have
a
choice
between
thread
confinement
(
unfortunately
,
the
default
,
which
is
obsolete
)
,
and
queue
confinement
.

With
thread
confinement
,
you
can
only
use
a
managed
object
context
from
the
thread
where
it
was
created
.

If
you
created
your
managed
object
context
on
the
main
thread
(
or
queue
)
,
you
can
only
use
it
from
there
-
so
any
Core
Data
operation
you
perform
on
that
context
will
block
the
main
thread
,
and
in
turn
the
UI
.

Using
queue
confinement
(
almost
)
any
operation
on
the
managed
object
context
must
go
through
either
the
performBlock
:
or
performBlockAndWait
:
methods
.

The
enqueued
block
is
executed
on
the
context
's
serial
queue
.

This
is
far
less
failure
prone
than
thread
confinement
and
has
been
the
recommended
practice
for
concurrency
since
iOS
5
.

OP_BLOCK
:
(
output
omitted
for
annotation
)

Typically
this
would
be
done
using
an
NSFetchedResultsController
,
which
observes
a
managed
object
context
for
changes
relevant
to
it
's
fetch
request
.

Once
the
initial
fetch
populates
the
controller
it
will
listen
for
changes
to
the
context
that
affect
the
objects
specified
by
the
fetch
request
.

When
relevant
changes
occur
the
controller
informs
it
's
delegate
through
callbacks
.

On

So
there
you

by
calling
dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion

On

As

you
can
set
up
the

there
and
the

Or
for

you

You
do

to

the

it

All
you

is
'

it

Applying
the

does

it

to

the

that
jacoco
is

already

The

Yes
,
your
expression
fatally
confuses
the
JIT
optimizer
.

The
generated
machine
code
looks
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_211
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
bug
occurs
at
address
41
,
the
optimizer
has
concluded
that
value
will
always
be
null
so
it
directly
passes
a
null
to
String.Concat()
.

For
comparison
,
this
is
the
code
that
's
generated
when
JIT
optimization
is
turned
off
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_212
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
code
got
moved
,
but
do
note
that
at
address
5c
it
now
uses
the
local
variable
(
value
)
instead
of
null
.

You
can
report
this
bug
at
connect.microsoft.com
.

The
workaround
is
simple
:

CODE_BLOCK

A_213

to

The

The

gives
access
to
three

:

dbId
:
this
is
viewer
specific

used

such
as
for

Revit
ElementID

,
the

is
in

I
get
an

When

gets

this

intitialized
with

Is

Is

type
?

Answer_to_Question_ID

Question_URL

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2551073/

The
PersistentGenericSet
is
part
of
NHibernate
(
used
to
track
changes
in
collections
)
.

It
is
based
on
the
ISet
interface
and
classes
from
Iesi.Collections
,
which
was
used
to
fill
a
gap
in
the
.Net
framework
as
there
is
n't
a
Set
type
.

I
guess
that
WCF
has
a
problem
serializing
this
type
.

A
quick
fix
is
to
change
your
NHibernate
mappings
to
use
a
Bag
instead
of
a
Set
.

Then
you
can
use
a
normal
IList
<T>
instead
of
Set<T>
in
your
classes
w
.

A
better
solution
is
to
create
a
remote
facade
which
sends
DTOs
to
your
WCF
endpoints
.

This
will
allow
you
to
keep
the
interface
of
your
internal
types
separate
from
those
exposed
as
remote
services
.

Jimmy
Bogards
Automapper

tool

will
help
with
the
mapping
process

I
have
an
installer
created
using
Installshield
2012
that
depends
greatly
on
the
value
of
a
Registry
key
written
by
some
other
application
developed
in-house
.

I
use
RegDBGetKeyValueEx
Installscript
API
to
fetch
the
value
.

This
value
is
a
directory
path
guaranteed
to
have
a
trailing
backslash
.

This
value
serves
as
the
TARGETDIR
for
my
installer
.

The
issue
is
that
I
often
see
a
foreign
character
(
Chinese
,
Japanese
or
Korean
)
appended
to
the
backslash.This
causes
my
TARGETDIR
to
contain
the
foreign
character
.

This
pollutes
my
installation
.

I
feel
this
is
some
bug
with
Installscript
API
which
wrongly
translates
the
Registry
value
.

Please
provide
some
inputs
so
that
I
may
find
the
root-cause
of
the
issue
.

EDIT
1
:

The
other
application
in
question
is
a
purely
ANSI
application
with
no
support
for
Unicode
.

There
is
no
#define
UNICODE
specified
anywhere
.

I
also
checked
the
compiler
parameters
and
found
nothing
related
to
Unicode
specified
.

This
application
reads
one
Registry
key
and
appends
a
backslash
and
updates
other
keys
.

Once
this
operation
is
done
my
installer
fetches
the
values
written
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_1647
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
values
updated
in
the
above
code
are
then
written
to
registry
.

The
Installscript
code
that
fetches
these
values
is
:

Q_1648

When
assigning
the
Registry
data
to
your
m_reqPath
variable
,
you
are
treating
it
as
null-terminated
character
data
.

However
,
string
data
read
by
RegQueryValueEx()
is
not
guaranteed
to
be
null-terminated
,
if
the
original
writer
of
the
data
did
not
include
one
.

This
is
clearly
stated
in
the
documentation
.

Chances
are
that
the
string
data
you
are
reading
from
the
Registry
is
not
null-terminated
,
so
you
end
up
copying
random
data
from
the
end
of
your
buffer
.

To
account
for
that
possibility
,
you
need
to
allocate
extra
space
in
your
buffer
and
put
your
own
null
terminator
at
the
end
of
whatever
data
you
actually
read
.

If
the
data
is
properly
null
terminated
,
then
your
terminator
will
simply
be
redundant
.

You
are
also
leaking
the
opened
Registry
key
handle
if
RegOpenKeyEx()
succeeds
but
RegQueryValueEx()
fails
.

Try
this
instead
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2123
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

To
avoid
this
issue
altogether
,
use
RegGetValue()
instead
,
which
deals
with
the
null
terminator
for
you
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2124
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Or
:

CODE_BLOCK
:

An
AsyncTask
that
returns
nothing
from
doInBackground()
(
and
does
n't
communicate
with
onPostExecute()
via
private
members
)
is
always
suspicious
.

You
have
a
lot
of
side
effects
in
your
AsyncTask
and
that
kind
of
stuff
is
hard
to
debug
.

You
add
to
cityList
and
activeOrders
for
example
,
without
showing
what
that
actually
is
.

Presumably
those
are
lists
attached
to
some
Adapter
and
adding
to
those
might
trigger
a
View
attached
to
the
Adapter
to
be
re-drawn
.

If
that
is
the
case
you
could
try
calling
setNotifyOnChange(false)
on
mAdapter
(
to
delay
updates
until
you
manually
call
notifyDataSetChanged()
later
)
.

http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ArrayAdapter.html#setNotifyOnChange(boolean)

In
general
,
if
your
AsyncTask
does
n't
return
anything
or
otherwise
"
communicate
"
with
onPostExecute()
there
is
little
point
in
having
onPostExecute()
in
the
first
place
.

Even
better
would
be
not
to
have
any
side
effect
in
doInBackground()
and
instead
return
the
parsed
data
and
only
add
it
to
cityList
and
activeOrders
in
onPostExecute()
.

You

adapt
it
for

:

FYI
:
this
works
only
with

you

Of
course
,
this
is
a
useful
exercise
to
do
,
and
as
a
result
of
making
this
mistake
you
've
learned
to
better
understand
operator
precedence
and
parsing
in
Haskell
.

However
,
once
you
have
more
experience
you
'll
realize
you
could
have
avoided
the
problem
,
and
wound
up
with
simpler
code
as
a
result
,
by
using
pattern
matching
instead
of
composing
calls
to
fst
and
snd
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6259
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Now
the
code
is
shaped
like
the
data
it
consumes
,
and
you
get
to
give
descriptive
names
to
the
values
you
work
with
.

Another
improvement
comes
from
observing
that
this
recursive
pattern
is
very
common
:
you
do
something
to
each
item
in
the
list
,
independent
of
each
other
,
and
construct
a
list
of
the
results
.

In
fact
,
that
is
exactly
what
map
does
.

So
you
could
write
a
function
that
deals
with
only
one
of
these
PGM
items
at
a
time
,
and
then
use
map
to
extend
it
to
a
function
that
works
on
a
list
of
them
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6260
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Answer_to_Question_ID

The
problem
is
that
f
.
g
x
is
f
.
(
g
x
)
.

Therefore
,
the
types
do
n't
match
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6257
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

You
either
have
to
use
parentheses
around
fst
.
fst
or
$
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6258
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

You
can
also
combine
both
,
e.g
.

fst
.
fst
$
x
,
since
the
precedence
of
$
is
low
.

I
am
working
on
a
document
that
is
used
in
a
lecture
each
semester
.

The
contents
basically
stay
the
same
,
but
only
a
subset
of
the
content
is
used
each
semester
.

Defines
are
used
to
set
which
parts
should
be
compiled
and
which
not
.

In
one
part
of
the
document
a
list
of
the
options
is
compiled
in
a
tabular
in
the
following
form
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_6417
(

So
all
options
that
are
chosen
via
defines
are
listed
in
the
table
as
a
row
.

The
problem
that
occurs
is
that
the
&
character
seems
to
break
the
\ifdefined
and
is
treated
as
a
\fi
.

An
Incomplete
\ifdefined
error
is
thrown
.

I
worked
around
this
by
defining
a
command
that
just
outputs
the
&
char
.

But
there
sure
is
a
better
way
.

Note
that
I
am
working
on
someone
elses
document
and
cannot
just
change
the
whole
structure
and
the
use

Add

no

Sure

the

to

,
but

Found
mailgun-js
package
but
do
not
how
to
connect
this
package
with
ember.js
using
express
.

Or
if
there
is
any

Ember
runs
in
the
browser
while
sending
email
is
done
(
or
:
should
under
most
circumstances
be
done
)
on
the
server
.

express
and
mailgun-js
hint
at
that
that
's
what
you
really
want
to
do
(
as
they
are
server-side
node
modules
)
.

You
'd
have
to
hook
the
mail-sending
into
the
REST
backend
on
the
server
or
provide
it
as
an
extra
service
that
you
might
access
through
a
jQuery-Ajax-Call
from
your
ember
app

I
have
a
WPF
DataGrid
with
the
following
definition
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_5524
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
allows
me
to
have
the
user
selected
a
"
region
"
of
cells
.

The
DataGrid
is
bound
to
an
observable
collection
.

The
XAML
column
definitions
have
some
columns
hidden
,
some
visible
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_5525
(
code
omitted

)

I
also
have
a
Right
Mouse
Button
context
menu
defined
for
the
DataGrid
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_5526
(
code
omitted
for

)

I
would
like
to
be
able
to
Click
,
Drag
and
Drop
a
copy
of
the
currently
selected
cells
into
an
external
application
.

I
was
thinking
of
using
the
combination
of
pressing
the
"
Alt
Key
"
and
Left
Mouse
Button
click
to
initiate
the
DragDrop
operation
.

For
example
,
consider
the
"
irregular
"
selection
of
cells
in
the
DataGrid
:

I
am
unclear
on
how
to
proceed
and
have
several
questions
regarding
this
:

1)
What
events
do
I
override
so
that
the
/Left
Mouse
click
do
not
affect
the
currently
selected
cells
?

2)
How
do
I
determine
whether
the
Left
Mouse
Button
click
is
occurring
within
a
region
of
selected
cells
?

How
do
I
handle
the
data
piece
?

3)
Once
I
've
determined
the
above
,
what
is
the
next
step
?

Do
copy
data
into
the
clipboard
for
use
on
the
external
drop
?

4)
What
events
(
if
any
)
do
I
need
to
override
on
the
DataGrid
in
order
for
this
to
work
?

the
basic
events
to
drag
and
drop
are
:
events
to
drag
and
drop

Specially
the
DragLeave
and
Drop
to
do
what
you
want
.

Then
you
need
to
control
(
delete/add
)
the
GridData
property
from
your
VM
to
search
and
move
the
values
.

I
strongly
recommend
3rd
party
like
Telerik
to
do
it
.

Here
is
your
complete
answer
I
believe
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6280
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Here
you
need
to
have
the
shift
key
down
to
signal
the
drag
.

This
is
needed
to
disambiguate
the
click
and
drag
that
is
used
in
the
DataGrid
to
select
cells
.

You
might
use
some
other
mechanism
such
as
context
menu
item
.

The
clipboard
is
key
to
any
drag
and
drop
operation
.

What
you
are
doing
is
putting
data
on
the
clipboard
in
various
formats
that
the
target
of
the
drop
will
recognize
.

In
this
example
only
plain
text
is
used
.

But
you
might
want
to
create
rich
text
or
HTML
or
any
number
of
other
formats
.

The
external
application
you
are
dropping
on
must
be
registered
as
a
drop
target
.

You
cannot
force
the
other
app
to
respond
to
the
drop
...
it
must
be
listening
for
it
.

So
this
example
will
work
with
Word
and
Excel
.

It
will
not
work
with
Notepad
.

I
believe
all
4
items
are
satisfied
:

Override
the
preview
mouse
down
event
.

The
original
source
of
the
mouse
event
comes
from
the
data
grid
cell
.

If
the
cell
is
selected
then
you
are
within
the
block
of
cells
that
is
selected
.

For
the
selected
cells
,
gather
the
data
from
the
bindings
and
organize
into
a
grid
.

As
a
baseline
use
plain
text
but
optionally
add
other
formats
as
well
.

Use
the
DragDrop
class
to
actually
implement
the
drag
and
drop
.

Override
preview
mouse
down
.

I
've
seen
examples
using
crc
,
but
the
examples
I
've
got
my
head
round
work
with
generating
a
checksum
for
entire
table
data
(
for
use
with
replication
and
data
validation
)
.

For
example
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_6530
(
code
omitted

)

I
'm
trying
to
assign
a
checksum
value
to
each
entry
in
a
MYSQL
database
,
based
on
a
series
of
field
values
(
shown
above
)
.

The
idea
being
that
when
a
specific
set
of
fields
have
the
same
data
in
,
the
checksum
generated
would
be
the
same
and
I
can
deal
with
duplicate
entries
by
checking
the
checksum
value
,
instead
of
lengthy
checks
of
the
field
to
see
if
they
contain
matching
data
.

I
've
seen
this
in
SQL
SERVER
,
using
checksum_binary
,
which
is
so
fast
but
is
there
a
better
solution
to
apply
a
checksum
value
to
individual
fields
for
comparison
or
should
I
stick
with
trying

modify
the
above
?

I
do
n't
understand
why
you
are
doing
something
this
complicated
:

A
checksum
for
each
rows
with
3
columns
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_7178
(
code

)

To
insert
this
new
checksum
:

Alter
the
table
to
add
the
new
column
then

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_7179
(
code
omitted

annotation
)

A
note
the
checksum
wo
n't
be
100%
safe
as
if
the
last
character
of
1
column
is
not
there
but
find
in
the
next
column
the
hash
will
be
the
same
.

Maybe
you
can
add
a
separator
in
the
concat
to
be
sure

If
you
want
to
just
use
npm
just
install
each
package
with
a
separate
command

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2852
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

On
my
computer
it
works
.

My
suggestion
is
to
use
the
"
package.json
"
file
.

In
that
file
you
can
specify
the
libraries
you
need
and
it
's
going
to
download
the
dependencies
for
you
.

For
example

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2853
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

and
just
execute

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2854
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

And
npm
will
make
all
for
you
.

It
will
create
a
"
node_modules
"
where
there
are
the
dependencies
.

Just
create
your
js
files
in
the
same
directory
of
"
node_modules
"
and
the
dependencies
will
be
all
available
to
be
included
.

As
you
can
see
in
the
package.json
file
,
near
every
dependency
,
there
is
a
"
*
"
,
that
means
"
all
versions
"
.

If
you
want
,
you
can
set
a
specific
version
.

I

I

'

this

The

it

With

i

when

and
the
application
routes
me
to
the
dashboard
view
all
the
clients
gets
rendered
and
appended
to

the
same
thing
happens
when
I
access
/dashboard

afther
the

.

But
,
when

here
:

If

you

that

The

that
this.el

You

You
can
increase
the
frequency
of
background
scans
with
the
following
code
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3584
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
will
make
the
background
detection
times
as
fast
as
in
the
foreground
.

But
be
forewarned
,
this
will
make
your
app
use
lots
of
battery
power
.

You
can
tweak
the
between
scan
period
to
your
tolerance
for
battery
drain
.

As
you
noted
,
the
default
is
5
minutes
(
5*3600l
)
.

Android
L
has
new
scanning
APIs
which
promise
to
help
improve
this
tradeoff
between
detection
timers
and
battery
usage
.

But
for4.3
and
4.4
apps
,
you
need
to
make
a
judgment
call
.

I
'm
using
Java

.

Do
you
think
there
's
a
reason
why
there
are
conditional
expressions

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_275
(
code
omitted

and
not
loop
expressions

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_276
(
code
omitted

)

which
adds
elements
from
schedule
into
weeklyPlan
while
hasNext()
.

Or
do
some
languages
have
this
feature
or
something
similar
?

Answer_to_Question_ID

Question_URL

These
"
loop
expressions
"
,
in
a
slightly
different
form
,
are
called
closures
.

In
groovy-code
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_420
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

That
is
-
you
can
define
what
happens
with
each
object
of
the
schedule
collection
.

Java
does
not
yet
support
closures
.

There
it
is
implemented
with
anonymous
classes
.

Of
course
closures
are
more
than
that
,
and
this
is
only
one
of
their
applications
.

I
think
it
's
because
conditional
expressions
are
much
easier
to
implement
without
having
to
worry
about
pesky
details
.

For
example
,
looking
at
your
code
,
are
you
saying
that
weeklyPlan.add
will
be
called
multiple
times
?

In
that
case
,
the
scope
of
your
=>
operator
just
jumped
outside
of
the
parentheses
that
contain
it
.

C#
has
features
in
LINQ
that
can
perform
similar
actions
to
what
you
're
describing
.

It
implements
these
using
closures
and
extension
methods
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_421
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

But
these
are
much
more
tricky
language
constructs
than
Java
started
out
with
and
the
.NET
runtime
has
been
able
to
change
much
more
rapidly
than
the
Java
platform
has
,
largely
for
political
reasons
.

Java
7
was
supposed
to
feature
closures
,
but
they
got
pushed
back
to
the
"
next
version
.

I

the

You

then
use

you

it

so.
.
to
tell
you
about
the
benefits
of
not
using
jquery
for
this
:

jquery
will
process
and
wrap
every
single
element
in
a
browser
compatible
way
.

using
a
native
javascript
solution
would
speed
up
this
process
alot
.

using
native
textnodes
also
is
benefitial
since
it
will
not
break
event
handlers
for
child
elements
.

you
should
also
consider
using
fastdom
.

it
does
not
matter
if
you
are
using
jquery
or
native
js
.

after
writing
to
elements
the
dom
has
to
do
certain
tasks
before
it
can
be
read
again
.

in
the
end
you
will
loose
some
time
for
each
edited
element
.

to
give
you
a
fastdom
example
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4558

this
will
basically
do
the
job
in

if
you
want
to
go
even

you
could
add
this
to
jquery
as
following
:

CODE_BLOCK

and
call
it

Sounds
like
your
session
is
timing
out
.

You
need
to
either
force
the
user
to
login
again
,
or
extend
your
session
timeout
.

You
can
change
the
session
timeout
by
editing
your
web.xml
and
adding
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_859
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Which
will
give
you
a
session
timeout
of
60
minutes
.

-1
means
there
is
no
timeout
.

The
symptom
that
this
only
occurs
after
a
long
time
indeed
indicates
that
the
session
has
been
timed
out
.

But
changing
the
session
timeout
is
not
the
right
solution
.

You
have
actually
a
bug
in
your
JSP
.

Because
you
're
using
old
fashioned
JSP
scriptlets
<%
%>
instead
of
normal
Java
classes
such
as
servlets
to
control
the
request/response
and
do
the
business
stuff
in
the
JSP
,
it
's
harder
to
naildown
the
root
cause
of
the
NullPointerException
.

You
need
to
open
the
generated
homepage_jsp.java
in
server
's
work
directory
and
head
to
line
107
and
finally
trackback
this
line
into
your
homepage.jsp
so
that
you
can
fix
the
bug
.

Perhaps
you
need
to
do
a
request.getSession()
instead
of
request.getSession(false)
,
or
you
need
to
check
if
a
session
attribute
is
not
null
before
accessing
it
,
etcetera
.

Sort
the
array
when

is
1
dimension
before
you
build
the
multi-dimensional
array
.

Even
better
if
you
are
using
a
query
,
sort
it
there
.

Sort
by
parent
then
sort
.

When
you
build
your
multidimensional
array
,
each
child
will
be
appended
to
the
parent
.

If
they
are
already
in
the
correct
order
,
they
will
end
up
in
the
same
order

You
have
to
use
the
"

attribute
of
the
datatable
.

With
it
you
can
define
if
the
component
is
rendered
to
the
client
or
not
.

So
check
by
EL
if
the
list
is
populated
.

you
can
do
something

:

all

implement

if

This
way
i
'm
sure
I
never
get

I

Because

I
figured
it
out
.

I
was
sending
the
response
back
in
an
incorrect
manner
.

The
response
had
to
be
sent
back
as
a
POJO
object
directly
rather
than
serializing
the
POJO
and
sending
it
back
as
a
String
.

This
is
how
I
got
it
to
work
.

No
need
to
record
these
times
yourself
.

The
Pi
(
and
almost
any
Linux
distribution
)
writes
those
events
to
the
/var/log/wtmp
file
(
more
about
that
file
here
)
.

The
last
command
can
retrieve
those

(
also
see
the
manual

for
last
)
.

Try
the
following
:

CODE_BLOCK

A_3634
(

Explanation
of
the

:

-F
prints

-
which
is
handy
in
your

,
because
that

.

-R
suppresses
the

You

n't

.

-x

-
now
that

Next
,
it

update

To
decide
between
using
an
ArrayList/Vector
or
a
HashMap
depends
on
whether
you
have
key-value
pairs
or
simple
a
list
of
elements
.

For
key-value
pairs
a
HashMap
is
the
go-to
option
(
e.g
name
-
person
object
)
.

If
you
just
have
objects
but
no
real
keys
(
a
list
of
trees
in
a
forest
)
then
a
ArrayList
or
Vector
would
be
better
.

The
difference
between
Vector
and
ArrayList
is
more
subtle
.

If
you
want
more
information
on
the
difference
between
the
two
you
can
read
this
article
.

But
as
the
article
is
from
2001
,
the
information
is
n't
the
newest
.

In
most
cases
,
the
ArrayList
is
the
better
choice
and
Vector
is
pretty
much
considered
deprecated
nowadays
.

As
the
biggest
difference
between
the
two
is
,
that
Vector
is
synchronized
while
ArrayList
is
n't
,
which
in
most
cases
,
makes
the
Vector
slower
than
the
ArrayList
as
it
creates
unnecessary
overhead
.

For
more
information
you
can
look
at
this
question
:
Why
is

Many
decimal
numbers
are
not
exactly
representable
in
IEEE
floating
point
(
i.e
.
the
binary
representation
used
for
double
)
and
0.1
falls
in
this
camp
.

When
you
type
0.1
the
C++
compiler
is
required
to
convert
that
into
a
double
to
be
represented
on
your
hardware
.

It
does
so
by
computing
a
near
approximation
of
this
and
so
you
see
a
bit
of
error
.

If
you
try
something
like
a
power
of
two
:
0.5
,
0.25
these
will
be
exactly
represented
.

This
is
normal
behaviour
in
any
computer
.

It
's
caused
by
the
fact
that
decimal
numbers
are
being
stored
in
fixed-sized
binary
memory
.

The
extra
digits
come
from
the
inherent
errors
caused
by
converting
from
binary
to
decimal
.

You
will
not
get
rid
of
them
.

The
best
you
can
do
is
choose
a
precision
(
either
float
or
double
)
that
is
big
enough
so
that
the
extra
error
digits
will
not
make
any
difference
to
your
solution
,
and
then
chop
them
off
when
you
display
the
number

When

I
want
it

potentially
update
a

provides
the

However
,
when

I

Which

in

I
do

the
parameters
I

viewWillAppear

I
believe
could

time

(
Or
is

wrong

Since

it

the
wrong

having

inelegant
,
if
there
's
a
built-in
way
to
handle
this
.

To
clarify
,
this
is
not
a
memory
resident
cache
.

This
is
parsing
an
XML
file
to
binary
.

The
binary
is
loaded
and
unloaded
in
viewDidLoad
and
viewDidUnload
.

This
is
a
prerequisite
for
that
step
,
making
sure
the

is
up-to-date
prior
to
it
being
loaded
.

Using
init
may
work
,
but
I
would
recommend
a
simple
subclass
of
UINavigationController
.

Create
a
new
method
called
setRootTableViewController
:(
UITableViewController
*)
controller
,
or
something
like
it
.

In
the
method
implementation
call
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_854
(
code
omitted

reloadData
will
call
all
of
your
delegate
and
data
source
methods
,
and
use
them
to
update
the
table
.

If
you
want
a
special
method
call
on
your
table
view
controller
instead
,
you
could
change
the
method
declaration
to
setRootTableViewController
:(
CustomTableViewController
*)
controller
(
or
whatever
your
custom
table
controller
is
called
)
,
and
replace
the
reloadData
line
with
one
that
calls
that
method
.

Then
,
in
your
app
delegate
,
instead
of
creating
a
UINavigationController
and
adding
your
custom
view
controller
,
create
one
of
these
,
and
call
this
method
to
add
the
first
view
.

,
when

adds
a

If
I

the

it

and
everything
seems
to

(
no

no

This
is
a

I

there
's
something

there

how

OS
treats

To

the

put
a

a

That

When
there
is
no
physical
desktop
(
or
remote
desktop
session
)
,
the
Java
process
that
runs
Selenium
RC
will
result
in
a
black
screenshot
.

Without
knowing
more
info
,
this
could
be
your
problem
.

As
the
creator
of
Selenium
RC
,
I
actually
recommend
against
using
the
Windows
Service
entirely
.

Instead
,
do
what
we
do
at
BrowserMob
,
which
provides
free
monitoring
and
free
load
testing
services
,
as
well
as
a
recently
launch
instant
test
tool
that
takes
screenshots
of
your
site
from
multiple
locations
.

What
we
do
is
launch
everything
from
under
the
context
of
a
VNC
session
.

On
Windows
,
configure
VNC
to
launch
a
session
upon
startup
.

Then
make
sure
the
user
auto-logs
in
.

Then
place
a
.bat
file
in
Program
Files->Startup
that
launches
Selenium
RC
.

It
's
kind
of
a
pain
,
but
it
's
the
most
reliable
way
I
've
found
for
ensuring
that
Selenium
RC
starts
in
an
environment
that
supports
screenshots
,
launching
IE
,
interacting
with
native
events
,
etc
.

Good

I
am
attempting
to
convert
one
of
my
application
written
in
C#
-
Windows
Forms
to
C++
-
wxWidgets
.

My
app
is
borderless
and
has
a
thin

transparent
panel
on
top
of
the
form

can
be
used
to
move

(
I

from
this

Now
,
I
basically

both

You
do
not

to

about
'

'
the
event
-
the
OS
does
that
.

You
need
to
handle

is
EVT_LEFT_DOWN

Is
your

about
how

Have
you

?

AboveNumber
can
do

.

If
the

is
unordered
,
it
must
run
through
all
items
in
the
list
.

You
can
optimize
this
by
maintaining
the
list
in
order
,
i.e
.
by
making
sure
that
the
list
is
always
ordered
after
an

If
the
list
is
ordered
,
you
may
find
your

which
would
be
much

Waffle

which
performs
all
operations
involving
Kerberos
tickets
on

The

never

This

a

Kerberos
question

The

encrypted
by

The
problem
is
you
expect
that
Javascript
contained
within
an
ajax
response
is
executed
.

This
is
n't
the
case
,
the
browser
does
n't
execute
any
Javascript
contained
within
ajax
responses
.

It
might
be
possible
to
try
to
parse
out
the
Javascript
and
execute
it
in
some
way
,
such
as
eval()
but
that
would
be
nasty
and
not
a
good
idea
.

Using
eval()
you
also
have
to
consider
that
it
will
only
accept
valid
Javascript
,
so
you
could
n't
just
pass
your
response
to
it
because
that
includes
some
HTML
.

A
possible
solution
could
be
to
have
the
popup()
function
already
defined
in
the
page
or
an
external
Javascript
file
,
and
to
assign
the
click
handler
after
you
add
the
HTML
to
the
DOM
.

I
have
two
web
roles
and
one
of
them
runs
the
service
layer
consisting
of
3
WCF
services
connected
with
net.tcp
,
each
deployed
as
a
website
on
port
808
,
810
,
and
811
.

Now
I
want
the
service
layer
to
only
be
open
to
my
other
web
role
.

So
I
tried
to
make
one
of
the
services
endpoint
internal
and
to
give
access
for
my
front
web
role
.

Like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_3946
(
code

But
when
the
UserService
is
attempted
it
seems
to
time
out
.

OP_BLOCK
:
(

I
have
also
tried
to
set
<AllowAllTraffic/>
instead
of
<WhenSource
...>
but
that
has
no
effect
.

Second
attempt
:

After
some
feedback
I
have
tried
some
variations
to
set
a
FixedPort
and
PortRange
to
811
and
the
role
listening
to
port
="*"
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_3947
(
code
omitted

I
have
kept
the
NetworkTrafficRules
as
in
previous
attempts
.

I
also
added
the
following
code
to
make
sure
there
is
a
listener
for
a
dynamic
port
.

In
my
WebRole.cs
file
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_3948
(
code
omitted
for

Another
note
is
that
the
calling
service
uses
port
811
to
find
the
right
service
since
the
service
runs
three
different
WCF
project
sites
.

And
the
service
I
'm
calling
also
uses
a
specified
port
number
which
I
think
can
be
a
problem
if
it
all
of
a
sudden
should
be
dynamic
.

The
calling
service
looks
like
this
:

And
on

Refer
to
the
Javadoc
of
String.replaceFirst
:

The
first
parameter
is
a
regular
expression
(
meaning
characters
like
*
have
special
meaning
)
;

The
second
parameter
is
a
regex
replacement
(
meaning
certain
character
sequences
have
special
meaning
,
e.g
.
\
and
$
)
.

If
you
want
to
pass
in
strings
from
an
untrusted
source
(
like
user
input
)
,
you
need
to
quote
them
appropriately
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5826
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

However
,
String.replaceFirst
is
not
the
right
tool
for
this
job
.

It
wo
n't
work
correctly
if
there
is
a
match
for
the
search
string
before
the
one
you
are
really
looking
for
.

The
most
straightforward
modification
to
your
code
would
be
to
use
String.substring
-
you
know
exactly
where
the
thing
you
want
to
replace
is
,
so
make
use
of
that
information
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5827
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

(
This
would
replace
the
last
7
lines
in
the
loop
)

You
can
do
this
better
again
by
using
a
StringBuilder
,
to
avoid
creating
unnecessary
strings
in
the
loop
.

However
,
this
still
would
n't
work
in
the
case
of
multi-digit
or
negative

Q_1918
(

MyApp.Web
references
MyApp.Logic
,
and
MyApp.Logic
references
MyApp.Data
.

On
my
application

what
I
am
trying
to
do
is
simply

which
is

from

However
,
there
are
hundreds

.

The
purpose
here
is
just
to
display
data
to
the
user
(
with
paging
)
.

So
a
class
"
Get_Data
"
on
project
MyApp.Data
has
a
function
:

CODE_BLOCK

Q_1919

From
MyApp.Logic
,
I
am
just
passing
the
datatable
from
the
MyApp.Data
tier
to
MyApp.Web
.

And
then
the
gridview
is
bound
and
everything
is
working
here
.

So
what
I
am
doing
wrong
here
?

Is
it
really
bad
to
have
datatable
in
UI
level
?

Why
is
it
a
bad
design
?

Answer_to_Question_ID

Question_URL

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18562928/

The
notion
that
it
is
bad
practice
for
your
UI
to
create/load/consume
a
datatable
comes
from
the
idea
that
it
is
preferable
to
split
your
application
into
layers
that
specialize
,
the
most
common
split
is
to
have
3
layers
:

Layer
1
is
a
data
layer
responsible
for
communicating
with
the
database
and
populating
domain
objects
,
the
domain
objects
are
typically
defined
in
layer
2
which
also
holds
the
business
logic
for
your
application
.

by
domain
objects
i
mean
classes
that
represent
real
things
like
customer
,
bank
account
,
hotel
room
etc
.

and
by
business
logic
i
mean
the
rules
that
apply
to
domain
objects
during
events
i.e
.
when
a
hotel
room
is
booked
a
confirmation
is
sent
to
the
customer
.

the
third
layer
is
the
UI
layer
,
to
simplyfy
coding
this
should
only
deal
with
whats
in
layer
2
,
this
is
where
the
recommendation
to
not
use
datatables
in
your
UI
comes
from
.

the
motivation
to
split
your
application
really
start
to
make
sense
when
your
application
is
big
,
or
you
have
multiple
developers
working
on
it
,
or
your
using
unit
testing
.

If
you
're
in
that
situation
then
i
'd
try
and
find
a
friendly
member
of
your
team
to
explain
this
better
,
but
if
this
is
just
you
writing
an
application
on
your
own
then
i
would
n't
worry
too
much
about
it
,
write
lots
of
code
,
read
lots
of
books
and
this
stuff
will
make
more
sense
,
i
would
recommend
the
craig
larman
book
on
uml
and
patterns
.

this

I
'm
not
an
expert
on
either
Python
or
Django
.

What
I
am
doing
is
following
along
this
really
very
good
book
:
Test
Driven
Web
Development
With
Python
(
2nd
Ed
)
.

It
uses
Django
..
.

I
'm
also
using
a
Windoze
machine
(
W10
)
with
Cygwin
.

The
reason
I
mention
all
this
is
because
I
found
,
having
installed
Python
3.6
in
my
Cygwin
setup
,
that
I
had
to
use
pip3
,
not
pip
,
to
install
Django
.

My
installed
version
of
Django
was
1.11.8
.

To
follow
the
"
official
"
(?)

tutorial
here
they
want
you
to
have
Django
2.0
installed
.

I
successfully
managed
to
do
this
with
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_7034
(
code
omitted

Hope
this
helps
someone
.

Perhaps
someone
much
more
knowledgeable
than
me
can
talk
about
the
need
or
otherwise
to
use
pip3
for
all

I
'm
writing
some
software
that
talks
to
external
hardware
via
a
dll
(
moving
some
motors
and
reading
some
values
back
)
.

The
calls
to
the
dll
are
blocking
and
may
not
return
for
in
the
order
of
10
seconds
.

The
software
performs
a
scan
by
moving
the
hardware
,
taking
a
reading
and
repeating
for
a
number
of
points
.

One
scan
can
take
in
the
order
of
30
minutes
to
complete
.

While
the
scan
is
running
I
would
obviously
like
the
GUI
to
be
responsive
and
a
live
graph
(
in
an
MDI
Child
)
of
the
incoming
data
to
be
updated
at
each
point
.

Multithreading
seems
the
obvious
choice
for
this
problem
.

My
question
is
,
what
is
the
best
way
to
thread
this
and
talk
back
to
the
main
VCL
thread
to
update
the
graph
during
a
scan
?

I
currently
have
a
single
TThread
descendant
that
performs
the
'
scan
logic
'
and
an
array
of
doubles
in
the
public
var
section
of
the
ChildForm
.

I
need
to
fill
out
this
array
from
the
thread
but
I
do
n't
know
whether
to
use
Synchronize
or
CriticalSection
or
PostMessage
or
some
other
method
.

Each
time
a
new
value
is
added
,
the
main
VCL
thread
needs
to
update
the
graph
.

Should
I
really
have
an
intermediary
object
for
the
data
that
is
a
global
var
and
access
this
from
the
Thread
and
the
ChildForm
separately
somehow
?

I
find
that
populating
a
TThreadList
from
the
background
thread
,
then
posting
a
message
to
the
main
thread
that
there
is
a
new
item
in
the

,
then
processing
the
list
in
the

is
simple
and
easily
maintainable
.

With
this
method
,
you
could
store
as
many
readings
as
you
wanted
in
the

,
and
every
time
the

received
a

,
it
would
simply
process
all
the

in

Define

,
instantiate

and
add

Do

If
you
want
to
invest
a
little
more
then
a
simple
Synchronize
call
which
by
the
way
blocks
the
main
thread
,
you
can
add
a
simple
FIFO
queue
with
messaging
on
top
of
it
.

The
flow
of
data
would
be
like
this
:

The
thread
puts
the
data
into
the
queue
.

The
thread
post
a
message
to
the
main
thread
window
.

Which
one
I
do
n't
care
:)

You
handle
the
message
that
data
is
available
and
process
any
messages
in
the
queue
as
you
see
fit
.

The
code
would
look
something
like
this
:

the
queue
..
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2533
(
code
omitted

the
data
is
put

..
.

CODE_BLOCK

(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

and
processing
..
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2535
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
code
is
written
without
Delphi
and
checks
so
it
can
contain
errors
.

I
showed
the
example
using
my
freely
available
thread
safe
queue
and
TAnyValue
.

You
can
find
both
here

Also
please
note
then
I
did
not

any
check
if
PostMessage
was
actually
sent

You
should
check
that

SOLUTION

Well
,
that
's
what
I
get
when
I
use
a
bit
oldish
Symfony2
release
(
2.0-RC6
)
.

It
seems
that
there
was
a
bug
in
__construct
of
RoleSecurityIdentity
(
reported
back
in
December
'
10
)
.

Instead
of
instance
of
Role
it
should
be
instance
of
RoleInstance
.

I
should
probably
close
this
question
..
.

I
'm
pretty
new
to
whole
ACL
concept
in
Symfony2
but
I
understand
basics
behind
it
.

Last
night
I
was
trying
to
make
next
scenario
work
:

I
have
2
user
roles
(
ROLE_GROUP1
,
ROLE_GROUP
2)
and
I
want
to
setup
object-level
ACL
for
the
one
of
these
groups
.

If
user
with
ROLE_GROUP1
is
logged
in
it
should
put
this
role
into
ACE
,
otherwise
it
should
put
ROLE_GROUP2
.

So
far
I
wrote
this
code
(
really
almost
identical
to
official
docs
)
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_897
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
way
I
understand
it
,
this
should
grant
all
permissions
to
users
with
ROLE_GROUP1
role
.

Am
I
wrong
?

To
check
for
permissions
I
used
this
code
(
again
,
from
official
docs
)
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_898
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

..
.
but
it
always
fails
(
that
is
throws
an
exception
)
.

I
looked
into
the
ACL
tables
and
everything
seemed
normal
,
as
far
as
I
could
see
.

Am
I
doing
something
wrong
with
RoleSecurityIdentity
?

Is
there
any
way
to
achieve
this
scenario
?

Any
help
would
be
much
appreciated
!

EDIT

I
just
drilled
down
through
the
Symfony
's
code
and
found
out
that
permission
grant
fails
in
equals
method
of
RoleSecurityIdentity
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_899
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

It
turns
out
that
$sid->getRole()
is
string
"
ROLE_GROUP1
"
while
$
this->role
is
Role
object
of
ROLE_GROUP1
role
.

CODE_BLOCK

Q_6448
(

The
two
tables
are
related
through
Foreign-key
:
FkOriginalTextId

Basically
,
OriginalText
will
have
key/value
pairs

different
languages

If
a
particular
client
wants
a
certain
value
to
be
customized
then
it
goes
to

CustomText
table
.

An

OriginalText
:
Employee

CustomText
:
Staff-member
for
the
key
:
Employee
.

I

get
all
the
text
of
a

from
the
OriginalText
table

but
the
TextValue
should
be
overriden
if
there
's
a
custom

key
in

I

by
getting
the

values
to
a
temp

and
later
on
updating
them
with
CustomText
value

but
is
there
's
a
better
way
to
do
that

Perhaps
using

The
best
option
is
to
use
.one
instead
of
live
for
the
button
.

That
makes
more
sense.
.

If
you
do
not
want
to
use
it
then
you
can
use
a
Hiddenfield
in
your
page
and
when
the
click
event
is
triggered
then
set
the
flag
value.
.

Next
time
when
you
click
the

check
for
the
flag
value
,
if
it
was
already
executed
once
then
do
not
run
the

inside
it.
.

Also
note
that
.live
is

So
confusingly
@IfProfileValue
has
nothing
to
do
with
@Profile
or
@ActiveProfiles
.

@Profile
tests
to
see
if
a
profile
is
active
,
@ActiveProfiles
sets
them
as
active
,
and
@IfProfileValue
allows
you
to
check
things
in
Spring
Environment
.

Wut
?

I
'd
deprecate
all
of
them
and
add
new
ones
@IfEnvironment
,
@IfProfile
,
and
@ActivateProfiles
.

Commentary
aside
,
how
can
I
use
@IfProfileValue
to
detect
whether
i
have
a
profile
active
?

I
am
not
using
Spring
Boot
on
this
project
,
at
this
time
.

Answers
should
show
code
,
and
we
will
assume
that
I
want
the
test
to
run
if
the
profile
is
activated
as
@ActiveProfiles
(
"
test
"
)
.

I
tried
@IfProfileValue
(
name
=
"
activeProfiles
"
,
value
=
"
test
"
)
but
that
seems
to
have
the
test
skipped
,
which
means
it
's
not
matching
.

I
'm
going
to
speculate
the
problem
may
have
to
do
with
the
fact
that
ActiveProfiles
is
a
Collection
.

That
's
correct
,
and
I
explained
this
in
detail
here
:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/23627479/388980

..
.
which
I
'm
assuming
you
have
already
seen
,
since
you
commented
on
my
answer
yesterday
.

The
reason
that
@IfProfileValue
has
nothing
to
do
with
@Profile
or
@ActiveProfiles
is
due
to
the
evolution
of
the
framework
.

See
below
for
further
details
.

OP_BLOCK
:
(
output
omitted
for
annotation
)

These
statements
are
not
entirely
correct
,
especially
the
last
part
.

@Profile
is
used
to
selectively
enable
a
component
(
e.g
.
,
@Service
,
etc
.
)
,
@Configuration
class
,
or
@Bean
method
if
one
of
the
named
bean
definition
profiles
is
active
in
the
Spring
Environment
for
the
ApplicationContext
.

This
annotation
is
not
directly
related
to
testing
:
@Profile
should
not
be
used
on
a
test
class
.

@ActiveProfiles
is
used
to
designate
which
bean
definition
profiles
(
e.g
.
,
those
declared
via
@Profile
)
should
be
active
when
loading
an
ApplicationContext
for
an
integration
test
.

@IfProfileValue
does
not
allow
you
to
check
things
in
the
Spring
Environment
.

I
'm
not
sure
why
you
are
assuming
this
,
since
none
of
the
documentation
in
the
Spring
Framework
states
that
.

As
I
stated
in
the
aforementioned
thread
:

Please
note
that
@IfProfileValue
was
introduced
in
Spring
Framework
2.0
,
long
before
the
notion
of
bean
definition
profiles
,
and
@ActiveProfiles
was
first
introduced
in
Spring
Framework
3.1
.

In
the
aforementioned
thread
,
I
also
pointed
out
the
following
:

The
term
'
profile
'
is
perhaps
misleading
when
considering
the
semantics
for
@IfProfileValue
.

The
key
is
to
think
about
'
test
groups
'
(
like
those
in
TestNG
)
instead
of
'
profiles
'
.

See
the
examples
in
the
JavaDoc
for
@IfProfileValue
.

OP_BLOCK
:
(
output
omitted
for
annotation
)

That
depends
,
and
..
.

I
'm
assuming
you
mean
bean
definition
profile
when
you
say
"
profile
"
.

If
you
're
using
@ActiveProfiles
to
set
the
bean
definition
profiles
for
your
tests
,
you
cannot
currently
use
@IfProfileValue
to
determine
if
a
bean
definition
profile
is
active
,
since
the
bean
definition
profiles
configured
via
@ActiveProfiles
are
set
directly
in
the
test
's
ApplicationContext
and
not
as
a
Java
system
property
.

However
,
if
you
are
setting
the
bean
definition
profiles
only
via
the
spring.profiles.active
system
property
,
then
it
would
be
possible
to
use
@IfProfileValue
to
determine
if
a
bean
definition
profile
is
active
,
since
@IfProfileValue
in
fact
works
with
system
properties
.

For
example
,
you
could
then
use
the
following
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4699
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

OP_BLOCK
:
(
output
omitted
for
annotation
)

That
wo
n't
work
since
activeProfiles
is
the
incorrect
property
name
.

The
correct
system
property
name
is
spring.profiles.active
.

See
AbstractEnvironment.ACTIVE_PROFILES_PROPERTY_NAME
for
details
.

The
fact
that
@IfProfileValue
does
not
work
in
harmony
with
@ActiveProfiles
is
a
known
issue
to
the
Spring
team
.

Please

following
JIRA
issues

(
As

One
thing
to
add
is
that
if
you
'd
like
to
pass
System
Properties
through
to
your
test
,
having
them
propagate
through
to
the
JVM
if
you
are
using
a
build
tool
like
gradle
may
require
an
additional
step
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6932
(

)

And
then
business
as
usual
in
your
integration
test

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6933
(
code
omitted
for

)

Finally
you
can
execute
your
tests
from
the
terminal
with
the
property
you
specified
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6934
(

The
thing
I
like
most
about
@IfProfileValue
over
grabbing
the
System.property
and
checking
assumeTrue/False
manually
is
that
no
Spring
Context
is
loaded
(
or
flyway/other
migrations
you
may
have
)
keeping
unit

fast
.

Thus
if

then
still
the

But
I
am
facing
issue

if
I
use
url
as
url
=
reverse

it
gives
me
the

You
made
the
view
function
's
id
parameter
optional
,
but
it
's
not
optional
in
the
url
pattern
.

You
firsty
need
to
rewrite
your
pattern
as
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3738
(
code

=>
the
whole
'
id
'
sub-pattern
is
optional
,
but
if
it
's
not
it
must
match
one
or
more
numerics
.

Once
done
,
you
can
reverse
the

by
not
passing
any
of
the
args
nor

arguments
:

CODE_BLOCK

Firstly
,
I
know
LocationManager
does
n't
have
to
be
called
in
an
AsyncTask
as
it
's
already
non
UI
blocking
:)

I
have
an
activity
which

1
.
Gets
the
users
current
location

2
.
Calls
a
webservice
to
retrieve
a
list
of
specific
POIs
around
that
location
.

The
user
can
choose
to
view
the
results
as
map
or
list
using
a
TabActivity
.

Bearing
this
in
mind
the
AsyncTask
to
get
users
location
and
call
to
webservice
is
managed
by
the
TabActivity
view
rather
than
either
of
the
docked
views
.

So
I
want
the
TabActivity
to
start
an
AsyncTask
which
first
gets
the
users
location
,
then
calls
the
webservice
.

A
progress
dialog
prevents
switching
views
using
the
tabs
during
this
process
.

It
's
pretty
much
all
working
apart
from
getting
the
users
location
from
the
AsyncTask
.

The
webservice
code
is
written
,
the
mapping
and
overlay
code
is
written
,
the
task
progress
dialog
copes
with
orientation
changes
.

The
focus
on
location
is
speed
rather
than
accuracy
.

If
the
user
chooses
to
view
results
on
the
mapview
then
I
will
provide
a
'
My
location
'
button
which
will
enable
a
more
accurate
location
to
be
obtained
.

I
just
want
to
initially
get
a
rough
location
and
return
the
search
results
quickly
.

Maybe
I
'm
going
about
this
the
wrong
way
.

Maybe
I
should
display
the
map
view
,
let
the
map
activity
find
the
current
location
,
then
call
just
the
webservice
in
the
async
-
but
then
what
if
the
user
taps
the
list
view
tab
during
the
location
phase
?

I
was
also
going
to
allow
the
user
to
specify
their
default
view
-
some
people
may
prefer
a
list
to
a
map
.

In
this
case
I
would
have
a
listview
which
had
to
retrieve
the
location
.

Thanks
for
any
advice

I
sussed
it
.

The
problem
I
was
having
was
that
the
LocationListener
was
not
being
called
in
the
AsyncTask
.

The
reason
for
this
was
that
although
I
'd
created
and
prepared
a
lopper
in
the
thread
I
had
n't
called
Looper.Loop()

I
start
the
requestLocationUpdates
,
kick
off
a
timer
.

Either
the
locationmanager
responds
with
a
location
,
or
the
timer
expires
.

At
this
point
I
call
looper.quit()
to
ensure
things
return
to
normal
.

Seems
to
be
working
.

You
also
have
to
remember
to
respond
to
the
back
button
etc
,
cancelling
the
timer
and
looper
if
the
AsyncTask
is
cancelled
.

so
..............................................

Though
I
've
thankfully
found
my
problem
,
I
want
to
know
what
exactly
is
causing
this
to
happen
.

Is
there
some
sort
of
eclipse
shorthand
that
leads
to
the
"
9
"
'
s
appearance
?

Or
is
this
due
to
some
eclipse
bug
?

I
'm
still
a
beginner
at
java
,
so
I
ca
n't
make
a
solid
conclusion
.

I
tried
modifying
my
code
slightly
to
see
how
Eclipse
would
react
(
I
deleted
the
space
between
my
original
"
+
+
"
)
:

CODE_BLOCK

Eclipse
gave
me
this
warning
:

Multiple

line

Syntax
error
on
token
"

,
+

expected

Invalid
argument
to
operation
++
/
-
-

This
makes
sense
,
because
++
on
its
own
is
an
operator
of
sorts
.

Interestingly
,
however
,
if
I
put
a
space
between
the
"
++
"
,
then
the
warning
disappears
.

I
did
n't
paste
my
entire
code
for
the
sake
of
readability
,
but
if
necessary
,
I
can
edit
and
add
it
in
.

Some
clarification
regarding
this
would
be

No
,
it
's
not
a
bug
.

It
's
unusual
,
but
it
's
not
a
bug
.

The
first
thing
to
do
is
simplify
the
example
massively
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4546
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Result
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4547
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Now
admittedly
I
'm
using
strings
for
both
start
and
end
,
but
due
to
+
being
left-associative
,
that
does
n't
make
any
difference
here
.

(
If
start
were
an
integer
,
the
first
binary
+
operator
would
be
integer
addition
in
both
cases
.
)

Basically
,
the
extra
+
ends
up
being
a
unary
+
operator
with
'
\t
'
as
the
operand
.

Unary
numeric
promotion
is
applied
to
the
char
,
giving
int
as
a
result
.

So
the
code
becomes
effectively
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4548
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

which
is
effectively
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4549
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

which
is
effectively

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4550
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

..
.
at
which
point
it
's
hopefully
clear
why
you
're
getting
the
output
you
are
.

To
avoid
accidentally
ending
up
treating
a
character
as
an
integer
,
it
's
probably
best
to
just
use
strings
instead
-
at
which
point
the
code
wo
n't
compile
because
there
's
no
unary
+
operator
for
String
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4551
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

.
.
gives
:

The
problem
is
not
just
with
the
+
+
in
your
code
.

But
it
's
also
with
the
fact
that
you
are
using
char
'
\t
'
and
not
String
"
\t
"
.

So
when
you
use
System.out.println
(
"
Hello
"
+
'
\t'
)
;
,
the
\t
is
taken
as
a
character
literal
and
appended
to
the
string
as
\t
.

But
when
you
use
System.out.println
(
"
Hello
"
+
+
'
\t'
)
;
,
it
becomes
effectively
System.out.println
(
"
Hello
"
+
(
+
'
\t'
)
)
;
.

So
it
is
treated
as
an
int
by
java
.

You
only
assign
+
and
-
signs
to
ints
,
not
chars
.

Remember
you
can
do
int
i
=
+2
or
-2
or
+
+
2
.

And
the
ASCII
value
of
\t
is
9
.

Hence
it
gets
appended
to
the
string
and
get
's
printed
as
Hello9
.

I
am
trying
to
draw
a
border
that
looks
exactly
like
the
one
a
ListView
on
Windows
10
has
.

I
am
doing
this
because
,
Fixed3D
looks
sunken
,
and
FixedSingle
looks
different
from
the
aforementioned
border
.

With
the
Magnifier
,
I
found
out
that
the
Windows
10
border
is
two-pixel
wide
.

So
,
my
idea
was
create
a
custom
panel
that
has
no
borders
but
draws
two-pixel-wide
rectangles
on
its
client
area
,
and
fit
a
child
,
whose
border
is
set
to
none
,
inside
the
rectangles
.

I
have
tried
the
following
,
but
it
does
not
work
well
with
the
Designer
,
nor
does
it
work
at
all
.

What
is
wrong
?

The
description
of
AffectedControl
is
"
Gets
the
child
control
affected
by
the
change
"
.

But
weirdly
,
it
was
actually
the
panel
itself
.

So
I
changed
it
like
the
following
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6041
(

omitted

)

It
works
,
but
there
is
some
flickering
when
resizing
the
panel
,
probably
because
it
is
actually
two
controls
,
not
one
as
the
native
border
is
.

You

You
ca
n't
draw
in
the

if
using
the
Draw

from

Better
to
use
a

It

I
'm
trying
to
write
some
generic
code
for
handling
drops
in
WPF
drop
targets
.

AllowDrop
is
set
to
true
,
and
I
've
hooked
onto
DragEnter
,
DragOver
,
DragLeave
,
&
Drop
on
the
drop
target
UIElement
.

Using
the
bubbling
events
enables
nesting
of
drop
targets
.

Note
I
have
no
access
to
the
drag
source
-
this
is
inter-application
drag
&
drop
.

If
I
have
some
UI
cleanup
to
perform
at
the
end
of
a
potential
drop
,
and
the
user
presses
Esc
to
cancel
the
drop
,
the
drop
target
never
seems
to
gets
a
specific
event
that
I
can
differentiate
from
all
the
others
.

Drop
is
easy
-
but
what
indicates
a
cancel
?

The
problem
I
have
is
this
:

DragLeave
is
a
bubbling
routed
event
.

e.OriginalSource
is
always
set
for
this
event
(
and
the
corresponding
Preview
)
via
hittesting
.

The
target
is
an
ItemsControl
(
Listbox
is
what
I
've
currently
been
testing
with
)
.

As
I
drag
over
my
intended
drop
target
,
I
get
loads
of
DragLeave
events
from
the
child
visuals
within
the
target
.

I
never
get
any
from
the
target
itself
.

Grids
,
rectangles
,
borders
,
textblocks
,
they
all
happily
send
me
DragLeave
,
but
none
from
the
actual
ItemsControl
I
'm
connected
up
to
.

I
thought
it
might
be
a
hittesting
problem
,
but
I
've
set
the
Background
of
the
ItemsControl
to
a
colour
,
and
it
makes
no
difference
.

What
am
I
missing
?

How
am
I
supposed
to
determine
that
a
drop
operation
has
definitely
finished
?

(
The
actual
problem
I
'm
trying

is
that
I

implementing

when
you
hover

You
do
have
a
complex
scenario
here
so
this
will
start
basic
in
hopes
of
giving
you
a
direction
and
hopefully
a
solution
.

The
framework
will
only
inform
of
a
DragEnter
event
if
the
control
is
marked
with
AllowDrop
=
true
.

So
make
sure
you
've
done
that
.

It
sounds
like
you
have
but
I
just
want
to
be
sure
.

I
'm
not
sure
why
you
need
the
DragLeave
event
but
if
it
's
to
grab
the
selected
data
the
easiest
way
to
get
the
data
is
not
to
hook
into
DragLeave
but
to
hook
into
PreviewMouseMove
.

You
can
then
determine
if
the
mouse
is
pressed
and
how
far
of
a
distance
to
move
before
enacting
a
DoDragDrop
.

In
this
event
,
you
also
have
the
ability
to
add
and
analyze
Drag
Data
.

When
the
drag
starts
you
can
create
a
new
DataObject
and
send
it
with
the
DoDragDrop
call
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_931
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
drag
data
is
now
accessible
through
the
DragEventArgs
object
by
using
(
if
you
do
n't
rename
the
event
parameter
,
it
's
e
)
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_932
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

My
suggestion
is
to
add
some
unique
information
to
the
drag
event
data
to
differentiate
the
event
based
on
the
data
.

Either
your
data
item
from
the
listbox
selection
,
or
a
new
class
holding
your
data
item
and
another
indicator
if
needed
.

the
best
way
to
go
about
automating
a
number
of
processing/summary
SQL
scripts
?

I
have
a
number
of
scripts
,
clean-up
(
eg
,
update
,
delete
)
,
processing
(
eg
,
joins
)
and
summaries
post-processing
,
that
I
wrote
last
month
but
would
like
to
automate
.

What
's
the
preferred
method(s)
of
automating
the
entire
process
as
a
series
of
sequential
scripts
?

EDIT
:
All
of
this
is
run
on
MySQL
dbs
.

Similar
to
MAW
's
answer
,
except
I
would
use
a
Windows
Service
instead
of
a
command
line
app
(
no
GUI
)
,
and
split
out
the
individual
DB
scripts
into
separate
tasks
within
the
Service
so
that
they
can
if
necessary
be
called
at
different
time
intervals
,
log
their
results
separately
,
and
be
independently
configured
.

This
depends
greatly
on
your
DBMS
.

In
SQL
Server
there
are
scheduled
jobs
which
can
run
any
combination
of
stored
procedures/commands
on
a
schedule
,
similar
to
Windows
scheduled
tasks
.

Since
you
've
tagged
this
question
with
mysql
,
I
'll
assume
thats
what
your
running
.

One
way
to
do
this
on
mysql
is
:

http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/event-feature.html

If
all
else
fails
,
you
can
reference
all
of
these
scripts
in
a
stored
procedure
,
than
create
a
simple
command
line
program
which
would
connect
to
that
db
and
call
that
procedure
.

Then
schedule
that
program
with
Windows
Task
scheduler
or
similar
.

ORDER

But
equally
important
,
you

using

a
way
where
you
seem

think
that
it

It

not

It

If

you
should
be
able
to
find
q
on
master
by
searching
its
merge

unique
name
(
e.g
.
by
using

then
entering
a

because
Git
by
default
records
the
merged
branch
names
in
merge
commit

Otherwise
,
you
could
just
search
for
the

after

If

you

cherry
pick

squash

Given
three
major
competing
applications
each
implementing
a
slightly
different
data
schema
for
the
same
problem
domain
,
I
am
faced
with
the
task
of
implementing
:

a
"
canonical
"
data
schema
expressive
enough
to
represent
something
like
the
intersection
set
of
features
of
all
3
applications
as
well
as
additional
details
(
meta
data
)

converters
for
doing
(
bidirectional
)
data
exchange
between
those
3
applications
and
the
canonical
schema

How
I
currently
approach
the
task

The
canonical
schema
is
defined
using
XSD
and
closely
resembles
the
data
schema
of
one
of
the
3
applications
,
let
's
call
it
A
.

This
renders
data
exchange
with
A
trivial
.

In
order
to
allow
for
a
bidirectional
data
exchange
with
applications
B
and
C
(
create
some
state
in
A
,
load
it
into
B
,
alter
it
in
B
,
load
the
altered
state
into
A
)
,
I
try
to
map
simples
states
in
A
onto
more
complex
states
in
B/C
which
can
be
identified
and
deconstructed
in
the
reverse
mapping
.

OP_BLOCK
:
(
output
omitted
for
annotation
)

Why
I
want
to
change
my
approach

Most
of
the
schema
mappings
are
pretty
trivial
(
the
name
of
an
object
in
A
simply
maps
to
the
name
of
the
object
in
B
)
,
so
I
would
like
to
avoid
writing
a
lot
of
trivial
code
by
hand
.

I
imagine
that
this
trivial
code
could
be
generated
given
a
formalized
mapping
between
the
data
schemes
.

For
the
nontrivial
parts
of
the
mapping
(
like
the
one
desribed
above
)
,
I
expect
lots
of
changes
in
the
future
simply
because
it
seems
so
arbitrary
.

In
many
cases
a
specific
convention
for
mapping
states
in
A
onto
more
complex
states
in
B/C
might
run
into
a
dead
end
at
some
point
.

For
example
it
might
become
necessary
for
users
to
change
the
"
mirrored
subspace
"
label
and
therefore
another
approach
for
identifying
conversion
artifacts
might
be
necessary
.

I
imagine
that
a
formalized
mapping
could
be
a
tool
to
transparently
manage
those
conventions
.

Maybe
a
reasoner
could
even
automatically
spot
incoherent
,
inconsistent
mappings
.

It
might
also
allow
me
to
more
easily
discuss
the
mapping
with
domain
experts
and
users
.

Questions

From
what
I
read
about
ontologies
I
have
the
impression
that
what
I
want
is
an
ontology
.

Is
this
correct
?

As
I
understand
it
,
using
an
ontology
to
describe
the
mapping
would
also
require
me
to
express
the
data
schemes
themselves
in
the
ontology
(
so
a
relation
"
maps
to
"
can
reference
a
type
from
A
and
a
type
from
B
)
.

Since
those
schemes
are
taken
from
long-lived
applications
,
they
are
not
always
coherent
.

For
example
,
a
"
feature
"
in
the
application
might
cause
some
state
to
have
a
different
semantic
that
you
would
expect
from
the
semantics
of
its
constituents
.

Can
existing
tools
help
me
with
managing
those
complexities
?

I
expect
that
I
would
require
some
additional
machinery
inside
the
ontology
to
describe
something
like
-taken
from
the
example
above
-
the
difference
between
a
"
permanent
mirrored
subspace
"
and
a
"
dissipating
mirrored
subspace
"
(
two
types
+
a
special
relation
reconnecting
them
?
)
.

Would
this
be
much
effort
to
do
?

Do
available
ontology
languages
provide
something
out-of-the-box
to
express
this
?

Is
this
application
of
ontologies
a
common
application
for
ontologies
or
is
it
a
corner
case
?

Do
you
know
of
companies
who
provide
services
for
this
application
?

Which
tools
would
you
suggest
for
creating
the
ontology
?

I
assume
there
are
no
off-the-shelf
tools
available
for
the
code
generation
mentioned
.

So
how
would
you
approach
the
code
generation
task
?

This

facing
a

I
have

spent
on
Google
.

Apologies
in

for
the
lack

,
stackexchange
will
not
allow
me
to

until
my
reputation

I
need
to
get
results
from
a
.do
page
:

http://webapps2.rrc.state.tx.us/EWA/productionQueryAction.do

The
url
remains
static
when
a
large
query
e.g
is
submitted
-
I
cannot
alter
my
query
by
changing
the
url
.

Once
submitted
,
it
takes
a
long
time
to
load
,
and
after
loading
,
a
table
of
results
is
presented
.

I
then
require
all
the
data
to
be
on
one
page
so
I
select
'
View
All
'
as
the
page
size
from
the
drop

on
the
top
left
of
the
table
to
obtain
the
following
page
(
which
has
many
more
rows
than
displayed
here
)

Finally
,
to
then
import
this
data
,
I
open
a
spreadsheet
and
copy-paste
it
all
in
.

Even
for
one
county/query/submission
,
this
process
is
extremely
tedious
,
and
I
have
to
do
this
monthly
for
about
20
counties
,
then
a
further
10
districts
.

Due
to
the
long
load
time
associated
with
the
return
of
each
query
,
this
is
a
task
that
easily
takes
2-3
hours
to
complete
.

As
such
,
I
am
hoping
someone
here
has
some
kind
of
solution
to
automate/ease
the
process
,
or
even
simply
advice
as
to
where
I
can
find
information
to
create
a
solution
myself
.

If
I
could
directly
query
the
database
import
the
data
into
a
spreadsheet
,
my
problem
would
be
solved
.

The
load
times
are
irrelevant
if
the
entire
process
of
querying
the
server
can
be
automated
as
it
could
just
run
in
the
background
without
user
input
.

I
apologise
for
the
long
and
non-specific
question
,
and
any

will
be
greatly
appreciated

Well
,
you
can
actually
check
the
network
calls
that
are
executed
in
order
to
get
the
CSV
file
.

I
just
did
that
for
you
,
but
it
contains
a
lot
of
parameters
which
you
need
to
send
in
.

Below
are
the
actual
parameters
you
need
to
send
in
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2761
(
code
omitted
for

)

I
hope
for
you
that
only
the
parameters
prefixed
with
searchArgs
are
important
(
they
contain
the
information
of
the
form
,
like
the
month/year/.
.

The
actionManager
prefixed
parameters
contain
some
complicated
data
,
you
need
to
define
them
(
else
you
get
an
error
)
,
but
I
do
n't
know
if
they
're
actually
used
,
so
you
might
just
leave
them
empty
.

When
executing
this
call
,
you
will
imediately
receive
the
CSV
file
which
you
can
probably
parse
using
any
language
(
look
for
a
CSV
parsing
library
)
and
insert
it
into
a
database
or
something
else
.

However
,
the
best
possibility
is
to
look
for
an
alternative
to
this
source
(
or
a
public
API
you
can
access

,
because
this

This

as
rather

just
cut

the

you

I
have
an
EF
model
where
I
logically
have
a
"
template
"
type
and
an
"
instance
of
the
template
type
"

Basically
my
templates
are
like
a
work
flow
and
the
instances
are
those
templates
applied
to
an
object
.

The
association
is
that
a
template
has
zero
to
many
instances
,
an
instance
is
always
based
on
a
template
.

For
example
the
template
may
be
"
send
letter
"
which
gets
applied
to
a
customer
to
create
an
instance
of
the
letter
sent
,
which
includes
the
date
sent
,
the
pdf
of
the
letter
etc
.

The
templates
have
a
few
subclasses/types
which
will
always
match
an
instance
which
also
has
a
corresponding
subclass
.

The
issue
is
how
can
I
ensure
that
when
I
create
an
instance
(
which
will
have
a
reference
to
the
template
)
that
the
instance
is
of
the
correct
inherited
type
.

For
example
if
the
template
is
of
type
TemplateType2
(
inherits
from
template
)
and
I
add
an
instance
to
loan1
.
.
loan1.TemplateInstances.add(foo)
…
I
want
to
ensure
that
foo
is
of
type
InstanceType2
.

The
way
I
am
doing
it
now
seems
like
such
a
hack
.

I
am
storing
the
instance
entity
name
as
a
scalar
value
in
the
template
entity
,
and
using
reflection
to
create
the
correct
type
of
the
instance
.

It
works
,
but
it
is
basically
using
the
value
of
a
property
to
do
mapping
,
exposing
the
possibility
of
all
sorts
of
errors
if
they
do
not
match
the
name
of
the
instance
name
,
or
worse
if
they
enter
the
wrong
entity
name
.

Any
ideas
or
thoughts
how
to
tackle
this
issue
?

I

The

"

a

The

In

If
you
can
decide
on
the
details
of
the
input
format
,
then
use
raw
python
source
code
.

For
example
you
can
store
your
tree
in
a
python
dictionary
of
nodes
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_287
(
code
omitted
for

)

Now
you
can
parse
this
tree
simply
with
the
python
parser
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_288
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Well
,
if
the
input
format
is
already
specified
,
then
we
cannot
help
you
if
you
do
n't
share
the
details
of
that
format
.

Question_URL

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2892716/

This
kind
of
syntax
is
really
the
target
for
pyparsing
.

The
basic
format
is
simple
enough
,
and
in
pyparsing
,
it
looks
like
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_558
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

But
once
you
start
to
add
arithmetic
expressions
,
and
boolean
operations
and
support
for
'
and
'
and
'
or
'
operators
,
things
get
complicated
.

Also
,
this
is
a
recursive
grammar
,
since
an
action
can
itself
be
a
nested
decision
.

Pyparsing
has
built-in
support
that
simplifies
definition
of
arithmetic
and
boolean
expressions
,
including
precedence
of
operations
and
gruping
in
parentheses
,
plus
recursive
expressions
.

Here
is
the
pyparsing
grammar
in
various
pieces
.

First
here
are
some
of
the
basic
parsing
elements
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_559
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
parse
action
attached
to
the
number
expression
will
automatically
convert
the
parsed
number
to
a
float
value
at
parse
time
.

The
Word
class
takes
two
strings
:
a
string
containing
all
valid
leading
characters
,
and
a
string
of
all
valid
body
characters
.

This
varname
definition
supports
variable
names
similar
to
Python
identifiers
.

Pyparsing
has
the
operatorPrecedence
method
that
takes
an
expression
for
the
basic
operand
definition
,
and
a
list
of
tuples
to
define
each
level
of
operators
:
an
expression
for
the
operators
,
an
integer
whether
the
operator
is
unary
,
binary
,
or
ternary
,
and
whether
left
-
or
right-associative
.

operatorPrecedence
takes
care
of
the
recursive
definition
of
arithmetic
expressions
nested
in
parentheses
.

This
expression
defines
basic
4-function
math
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_560
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Now
here
is
the
definition
of
a
boolean
condition
(
which
we
'll
eventually
use
to
define
the
decision
question
)
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_561
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Your
definition
of
actions
was
a
little
sketchy
,
so
I
made
up
some
possible
statements
:
an
assignment
statement
,
a
print
statement
,
and
since
this
is
a
speech
application
,
a
say
statement
which
is
very
simliar
to
print
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_562
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

In
addition
to
the
expression
definitions
,
you
'll
notice
that
some
expressions
are
followed
by
a
quoted
string
,
as
if
the
expression
is
a
function
being
called
with
that
string
.

In
fact
,
this
"
call
"
actually
returns
a
copy
of
the
expression
,
and
the
matched
tokens
are
tagged
with
that
name
.

These
results
names
are
very
helpful
at
post-parsing
time
at
picking
out
the
individual
matching
elements
(
similar
to
named
groups
in
regular
expressions
)
.

Finally
,
to
put
these
pieces
together
into
your
decision
expression
,
here
are
the
question
and
action
expressions
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_563
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Note
that
the
action
definition
can
include
a
decision
,
but
action
is
used
to
define
decision
.

To
break
this
chicken-and-egg
dependency
,
we
preface
this
section
with
defining
decision
,
but
with
a
placeholder
expression
using
the
pyparsing
Forward
class
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_564
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Then
after
question
and
action
are
defined
,
we
use
the
'
<<
'
operator
to
"
insert
"
the
actual
expression
definition
in
the
existing
decision
variable
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_565
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Again
,
I
took
liberties
with
your
defined
format
,
thinking
that
an
optional
else-clause
might
be
useful
.

If
you
do
n't
want
this
to
be
optional
,
just
remove
the
Optional
wrapper
around
the
Group(action)("elseAction")
.

That
defines
the
grammar
,
now
here
are
some
test
cases
.

Using
dump()
on
the
results
returned
by
parseString
is
a
nice
way
to
print
out
the
tokens
,
and
any
names
attached
to
them
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_566
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Here
's
the
output
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_567
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Here
is
a
link
to
the
full
parsing
program
-
http://pastebin.com/DnaNrx7j
.

This
is
just
the
first
stage
,
parsing
the
input
.

The
next
step
is
actually
evaluating
the
expression
by
processing
the
returned
tokens
.

The
pyparsing
wiki
example
SimpleBool.py
(
http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/file/view/simpleBool.py
)
includes
an
example
of
attaching
parse
actions
to
convert
parsed
tokens
into
callable
class
instances
that
simplify
evaluating
the
results
.

Hope
this
helps
.

Could

Why

What

I

what
CurrentUICulture
and
CurrentCulture
does
?

Suppose

I

doing
this
?

Answer_to_Question_ID
:
25289254

Question_URL
:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25289254/

It
's
pretty
simple
.

CurrentCulture
is
the
culture
assigned
for
thread
to
be
used
in
various
culture-specific
methods
.

To
example
,
ToString()
one
.

CurrentUICulture
is

OP_BLOCK
:
(
output
omitted
for
annotation
)

By
setting
both
you
ensure
what
all
ToString()
works
correctly
and
your
form
resources
are
loaded
from
appropriate
satellite
.

Regarding
usage
,
you
may
think
to
provide
user
with
option
to
change
language
.

To
example
,
I
have
native
German
windows
,
but
I
set
English
culture
in
it
(
date
format
and
default
culture
for
console
applications
)
,
while
I
speak
Russian
.

Which
language
do
you
think
I
will
chose
when
using
your
software
?

=P

By
default
,
either
take
language
chosen
in
installer
(
if
you
have
installer
in
multiple
languages
and
options
to
change
it
there
)
or
current
Windows
user
language
preferences
.

One
possible
scenario
:

Preconditions
:
application
is
already
localized
,
satellites
are
there
(
if
not
,
read
this
)
.

I
do
n't
like
satellites
myself
,
but
they
are
easy
to
start
with
.

When
application
starts
,
you
create
a
list
of
available
languages
(
either
statically
or
by
enumerating
satellites
)
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3484
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Then
,
if
application
start
for
the
first
time
(
to
example
,
you
have
string
language
setting
and
it
's
by
default
null
or
""
,
this
would
be
a
flag
what
no
language
is
selected
yet
)
,
you
detect
default
os
language

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3485
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

and
if
it
's
in
your
list
,
then
you
set

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3486
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Otherwise
,
if
you
do
n't
have
this
language
,
then
use
"
default
"
language
(
to
example
,
"
en
"
)
.

If
its
done
at
at
the
start
of
your
application
,
then
any
further
constructed
and
used
window
will
use
proper
resources
.

User
should
be
able
to
change
language
.

Give
him
possibility
to
chose
one
of
available
Languages
.

In
winforms
you
will
have
to
reload
forms
after
change
culture
.

Easiest
solution
would
be
to
simply
tell
user
what
"
software
restart
is
required
"
.

But
wait
,
I
've
already
set
environment
variables
in
my

Why
do
n't
they
work
?

If
you
've
set
environment
variables
in
your
/etc/bashrc
or
/etc/profile
,
then
these
environment
variables
are
made
available
in
your
shell
.

However
,
on
most
operating
systems
,
Apache
is
not
started
from
the
shell
and
does
not
load
environment
variables
defined
in
bashrc/profile
,
which
is
why
setting
environment
variables
in
/etc/bashrc
and

usually
has
no
effect
on
Apache

and
by

Yes

and
they

.

Unfortunately
,
the
C++
standard
also
allows
implementations
to
put
names
from
C-library

in
the

In

you
get
std::clock

all

I
got
an

show

of

.

I
need
to
convert
that

therefore
I
use

The
problem
is
in
the

the

wo
n't
show
up
because
the

The
second

it

So
I
am
using
the

that
I
got
off

here
:
http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_database.asp

modified
it

,
however
I
am
having
a
weird
issue
with
echoing
my

For

it

like
so
:

However
this

n't
working
anymore
,
the
closest
I
have
gotten
is
it
to
only
display
one
and
then
breaks
the
rest
.

the

echo
is
being
returned
into
the
following
div
tag

CODE_BLOCK

so
I
have
tried
changing
my

to
stuff
like
article

#sideWays
or
even
just
making
the

the

nothing
is
working

When
compiling
a
64bit
application
,
why
does
strlen()
return
a
64-bit
integer
?

Am
i
missing
somthing
?

I
understand
that
strlen()
returns
a
size_t
type
,
and
by
definition
this
should
n't
change
,
but
..
.
Why
would
strlen
need
to
return
a
64-bit
integer
?

The
function
is
designed
to
be
used
with
strings
.

With
that
said
:

Do
programmers
commonly
create
multi-gigabyte
or
multi-terabyte
strings
?

If
they
did
,
would
n't
they
need
a
better
way
to
determine
the
string
length
than
searching
for
a
NULL
character
?

I
think
this
is
ridiculous
,
in
fact
,
maybe
we
need
a
StrLenAsync()
function
with
a
callback
just
to
handle
the
ultra
long
process
for
searching
for
the
NULL
in
the
40TB
string
.

Sound
stupid
?

Yea
,
well
strlen()
returns
a
64-bit
integer
!

Of
course
,
the
proposed
StrLenAsync()
function
is
a
joke
.

1)

Why
32
bits

Why
not
16

It

It

,
when

,
size_t
is
defined
as
64-bit

This
makes

since

AS
@TheESJ
said
the
awaits
make
your
code
execute
in
a
serial
fashion
.

That
is
once
execution
reaches
the
first
await
,
execution
is
effectively
"
paused
"
and
will
not
resume
until
that
Task
is
complete
.

You
can
avoid
this
by
not
awaiting
the
Task
,
just
add
it
to
a
list
of
tasks
to
keep
track
of
.

To
facilitate
this
I
think
it
will
help
if
you
introduced
a
couple
of
helper
methods
to
execute
the
body
of
your
loops
and
return
a
Task
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3234

Then
in
your
main
loop
you
just
add
the
tasks
to
a
list
as
the
methods
are
kicked
off
,
this
will
essentially
execute
the
tasks
in
parallel
.

You
may
need
to
increase
the
number
of
concurrent
connections
your
server
can
make
if
it
causes
a
problem
.

Your

then

As

in

i
tried

change
the

of
Liferays
input-date
field
.

So
far
successfull

However
i
was

noticed
that
Firefox
messes
up
the

when
i

No

It

18.08.2017

But
when
i
click
the

(
no

it

Only
the

I
looked

saw

I

I

approach
to

In

@media
MIN-width
:

Min-width
media
queries
are
very
easy
,
to
use
,
and
are
not
too
different
from
using
MAX
media
queries
.

Here
is
an
example
using
your
code
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3780
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

It
is
important
to
still
use
max-width
to
create
limits
for
the
style
of
objects
on
certain
screens
.

Using
min-width
can
be
especially
useful
if
you
want
certain
styles
to
apply
to
a
smaller
object
and
then
have
that
same
style
apply
to
a
larger
object
.

This
way
you
can
keep
the
styles
for
that
minimum
size
but
also
add
on
extra
styles
to
the
larger
object
with
out
effecting
the
smaller
one
.

For
example
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3781
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

In
the
above
example
,
the
styles
from
screens
with
a
size
of
over
740px
will
already
be
applied
to
any
screens
with
a
size
of
over
900px
.

From
there
you
can
adjust
your
styles
as
you
like
,
reducing
the
amount
of
code
needed
to
produce
the
page
.

Other
Things
:

-When
it
comes
to
actual
elements
on
the
screen
(
excluding
min/max
-sizes
with
@media
)
it
can
always
be
helpful
to
use
percentages
,
because
that
way
items
can
be
auto
re-sized
according
to
the
screen
size
.

-Here
is
a
great
website
that
will
help
you
on
your
endeavours

It
totally
depends
on
the
rest
of
your
site
.

Some
sites
can
be
displayed
well
at
the
width
of
400px
while
some
others
need
to
set
a
minumum
because
it
's
too
small
to
render
the
document
objects
in
a
clean
manner
.

Very
often
you
will
not
even
need
to
use
min-width
or
max-width
when
optimizing
for
mobile
,
there
are
far
more
better
practices
.

Here
are
some
of
them
:

Use
Em
over
Px
-
It
is
always
better
to
set
font-size
and
other
sizes
in
units
of
"
em
"
rather
than
in
"
px
"
.

This
is
because
a
pixel
is
extremely
small
on
a
cell
phone
,
whereas
em
units
proportionally
adjusts
the
object
to
a
size
that
fits
the
screen
.

Use
Percentages
-
You
'll
find
that
using
percentages
are
far
more
friendly
than
,
for
instance
,
specifying
the
width
or
height
of
an
element
in
pixels
or
em
.

If
you
use
percentages
,
your
content
will
always
adjust
well
in
for
skinny
displays
.

Avoid
Absolutely
Positioned
Elements
-
Having
elements
positioned
absolutely
can
be
more
difficuly
to
handle
on
small
displays
.

It
simply
can
,
as
the
absolute
elements
may
get
too
near
to
the
relatively
positioned
elements
.

Use
relative
positioning
as
much
as
possible
for
a
clean
site
.

You
can
usually
create
a
new
,
sanitised
,
table
,
depending
on
the
actual
DB
server
you
are
using
.

The
hard
thing
is
that
if
there
are
other
tables
in
the
database
,
you
may
have
issues
with
foreign
keys
,
indexes
,
etc
which
will
refer
to
the
original
table
.

Whether
making
a
new
sanitised
table
will
be
quicker
than
updating
your
existing
table
is
something
you
can
only
tell

Using
CakePHP
I
have
a
page
where
I
have
multiple
forms
.

Each
form
updates
a
single
field
on
a
record
.

I
'm
trying
to
implement
a
way
to
submit
all
the
forms
through
a
single
"
Submit
All
"
button
.

However
,
all
my
solutions
so
far
have
been
lest
than
successful
.

My
first
attempt
was
to
create
a
separate
action
called
editAll
in
the
controller
that
took
an
array
,
but
I
cannot
figure
out
how
to
send
the
data
from
all
the
forms
to
that
action
without
having
a
hidden
form
that
saves
all
that
data
.

The
second
idea
was
to
create
some
kind
of
Javascript
function
that
iterated
over
all
the
forms
to
create
an
array
to
be
sent
to
the

's
editAll
action
.

The
first
implementation
did
not
work
,
and
I
could
n't
find
a
reasonable
way
to
implement
the
second
idea
.

Basically
,
I
was
hoping
someone
could
point
me
in
the
direction
to
submitting
multiple
forms
(
or
at
least
the
data
from
multiple
forms
)
at
once
from
a
single
page
.

I
assume
you
do
n't
ALWAYS
want
to
submit
them
all
-
if
you
do
,
then
just
make
one
form
.

If
you
're
hoping
to
be
able
to
submit
some
of
them
individually
,
but
also
be
able
to
submit
them
all
,
then
you
could
do
something
along
the
lines
of
this
:

Keep
all
the
fields
in
one
form
.

For
each
field
have
a
'
submitted
'
value
(
1
or
0
)
.

If
they
click
the
Submit
next
to
an
individual
field
,
turn
all
of
the
submitted
values
to
0
except
that
one
,
then
submit
the
form
.

If
they
click
Submit
All
,
then
turn
them
all
to
'
1
'
and
submit
the
form
.

Then
,
when
you
process
the
data
,
just
strip
anything
that
does
n't
have
'
submitted
'
value
of
1
.

It
would
still
take
some
work
,
and
you
're
submitting
more
data
than
is
necessary
,
but
...
.
it
's
an
idea
.

Based
on
your
2nd
comment
to
the
original
question
,
I
think
it
is
best
to
look
at
using
Panels
.

Look
at
using
multiple
panels
for
each
of
the
activities
you
want
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_1509
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Ensure
all
panels
are
hidden
when
initialised
,
and
then
simply
swap
a
panel
for
another
one
upon
a
button
click
event
using
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_1510
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Depending
on
the
layout
you
use
,
there
are
also
other
techniques
.

For
example
,
rather
than
removing
and
adding
(
or
showing
and
hiding
multiple
panels
)
,
if
you
use
BorderLayout
you
can
simple
"
replace
"
a
BorderLayout
area
with
another
panel
and
then
revalidate
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_1511
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Note
also
that
different
Operating
Systems
(
Windows
,
Mac
etc
)
will
have
different
styles
they
like
to
adhere
to
.

For
example
you
mentioned
a
typical
Windows
installer
;
people
have
come
to
expect
an
installer
to
look
and
work
in
a
certain
way
,
but
on
a
different
OS
there
are
a
completely
different
set
of
expectations
and
looks
.

(

Edit
:

OP_BLOCK
:
(
output
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
comes
down
to
personal
preference
.

Do
you
want
to
initalise
everything
on
startup
and
have
quicker
swaps
between
panels
(
or
as
you
called
them
:
"
screens
"
)
,
OR
do
you
want
a
quicker
inital
startup
and
essentially
have
"
lazy
loading
"
of
each
component
as
and
when
you
need
it
.

Personally
I
opt
for
everything
during
initalisation
(
unless
there
is
a
lot
of
things
to
do
or
load
during
your
applications
startup
)
.

This
really
comes
down
to
personal
preference
.

Another
edit
:

Speaking
about
layouts
,
perhaps
a
different
layout
style
would
also
help
you
out
,
something
like
this

Hope
this
helps
out
somewhat

You
set
the

to

;
therefore
,
the
browser
is
unable
to
break
the
headers
,
so
the
width
of
the
table
will
be
bigger
than
the
container
div
.

You
can
set
,
overflow

hidden
;
to
cut
the
overflowing
parts
,
or
overflow

auto

to
create

There
are
two
solutions
.

i)
IF
you
want
to
STRICTLY
contain
table
WITHIN
div
then
overflow:auto
;
is
the
way
to
go
.

ii)
BUT
if
you
change
your
mind
and
want
to
WRAP
div
to
the
width
of
table
then
.

display:table
;
is
the
way
to
go
.

Generally
its
bad
idea
to
contain
wider

I

My

that

it

But
when
I
try

run
a

that
was
generated
via

it
goes
hay-wire
and
simply
reports
back
that
a

.

Now
my

I
know
that
it
has
quite

but
it
just
read
a
single
line
.

I
opened
this
file
in
Sublime

I
could
see
all
the
separate
lines
,
however
when
I

It
displayed
only
a

a

with
a
character
'
^M

at
the
end
of
each

My
guess
it
that
it
is
using
this
as
the
line
terminator
)
.

A

If

if

treat

The
first
problem
even
before
you
get
to
line
breaks
is
that
you
're
reading
bytes
and
then
treating
those
as
characters
.

You
're
effectively
assuming
an
encoding
of
ISO-8859-1
which
may
well
not
be
correct
.

You
should
be
using
an
InputStreamReader
instead
.

Then
there
's
the
issue
of
operating
systems
having
different
line
breaks.
.
use
BufferedReader.readLine()
to
read
a
line
in
a
way
that
handles
line
breaks
of
\n
,
\r
or
\r\n
.

your

One

that

There
are
several
reasons
that
you
would
not
want
to
do
this
.

First
,
vector
drawables
are
only
supported
on
Android
5.0
+
.

If
you
are
only
targeting
Lollipop
and
above
,
this
wo
n't
be
an
issue
,
but
you
will
still
need
PNGs
for
older
versions
of
Android
.

Second
,
converting
raster
to
vector
will
in
most
cases
yield
poor
results
.

Instead
,
you
should
start
by
creating
the
original
assets
as
vector
images
in
a
program
like
Illustrator
.

Then
export
to
SVG
for
conversion
to
VectorDrawable
format
and
export
to
PNG
for
the
DPI
buckets
you
'd
like
to
support
on
pre-5.0
devices
.

quotes

with
the
exact

capitalization
as
they
are
in
the
table
:

SELECT
*
FROM
"

WHERE
"
Hours

25
;

Note
this
says
"
Hours
"
instead
of
"
HOURS
"
.

For
this
reason
,
it
's
best
to
use
all-lowercase
for
your

table
names
.

In
addition
,
when
using
lowercase
you
wo
n't
need
to
put
the
double-quotes
around
the
column
names
unless
they
are
a

word
that
might
mean
something

When
you
compare
numbers
as
strings
,
you
have
to
think
about
alphabetical
order
.

The
magnitude
of
the
number
is
meaningless
,
at
this
point
is
merely
a
word
.

So
"
25
"
is
greater
than
"
100
"
because
the
"
2
"
comes
after
the
"
1
"
in
an
alphabetical
sense
.

What
you
need
to
do
is
either
cast
your
"
Hours
"
field
as
integer
(
or
fix
that
damned
table
because
numbers
in
string
fields
is
nasty

You

fake
a

name
by
defining
all-lowercase
function
names
and
using
bash
's

names

yourself

So
if
apple
is
a
function
,
but
you
try
to
call
it
as
ApPlE
,
command_not_found_handle
is
called
with
the
command
as
the
arguments
.

The
first
line
takes
the
first
argument
(
ApPlE
)
and
lower-cases
it
.

Then
it
attempts
to
run
apple
with
the
original
arguments

Why

what

to

You

you
will

to
pin

You

horizontal

To
ensure
that
the
spacing
is
always
equal
between

In

when

you

to

Using

then
align
the

align
centre
in
the
horizontal
and
use
vertical
spacing

as

The
correct
approach
is
to
use
a
container
view
,
which
derives
its
height
from
its
subviews
.

The
container
view
is
then
pinned
to
the
centre
of
the
cell
-
you
would
n't
have
any
constraints
linking
the
container
to
the
top
and
bottom
edges
of
the
cell
.

Within
the
container
,
the
vertical
constraints
would
be
|[label1]-[label2]|
,
which
would
make
the
container
the
height
of
the
two
labels
plus
the
space
,
and
the
centre
of
the
container
view
would
be
between
the

Maybe

take

look
at
the
queryParams
option
(
http://emberjs.com/guides/routing/query-params/

With

params
you
can
set

to
be
a
query
param
in
your

like
http://yourdomain.com/someroute?limit=15

Your

continue
is
maybe
one
of
the
worse
feature
of
java
,
with
the
break
keyword
(
except
in
switch
statements
)
.

It
leads
to
jigsaw
code
where
you
have
to
find
out
where
the
code
jumps
.

One
continue
may
be
practical
but
it
gets
very
hard
to
change
the
code
it
produces
(
think
about
adding
an
inner
loop.
.
)
,
and
2
continues
will
make
you
crazy
.

You
can
always
avoid
using
continue
,
there
is
always
another
solution
.

Same
for
break
.

Here
,
why
do
n't
you
just
use
some
kind
of

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_1183
(

That
's
easy

simple

clear

even
better
when
you
have
a
separate
method
that
contains
processing
.

Also
,
in
your

that
is
tied
to
robustness
,
you
could
provide
a
process()
method
that
throws
an
exception
if
the
data
entered
is
not
valid
.

This
makes
it
even
more
clear
that
there
is
a

behavior

a
bunch

strange
cases
you
handle

scalesPagesToFit
to
get

there

some

But
then
to

This
is
bug
reported
on
https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=73697&thanks=73697

Since
API11
you
can
simply
use
android:baselineAlignBottom
=
"
true
"

Below
API11
you
can
overwrite
getBaseLine()
.

Update
to
Android
Support
Library
23.2.1
,
this
may
solve
your
problem

I

Setting

you

We
have
recently
started
a
project
to
store
a
load
of
data
on
a
Hadoop
/
HBase
cluster
.

I
have
followed
the
tutorial
in
the
Apache
'
Quick
Start
'
guide
,
and
have
got
a
small
standalone
HBase
instance
running
successfully
on
one
of
our
servers
.

I
am
able
to
use
HBase
shell
to
create
tables
,
put
data
,
get
,
scan
etc
-
looks
good
!

Now
my
problem
:
our
servers
where
HBase
will
be
installed
are
all
linux
,
but
all
the
developers
in
my
company
use
Windows
machines
-
it
would
be
nice
if
we
did
n't
have
to
make
everyone
in
the
company
install
Cygwin
just
to
use
the
Java
API
.

Currently
,
when
I
try
to
connect
running
from
inside
Eclipse
with
the
Java
API
,
I
get
the
following
error
:

CODE_BLOCK

Q_3150
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Followed
eventually
by
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_3151
(
code
omitted
for

)

My
question
is
:
is
it
possible
to
use
the
Java
API
for
HBase
on
Windows
,
connecting
to
a
server
running
on
Linux
,
without
installing
Cygwin
,
Hadoop
and
HBase
on
every
developer
's
machine
?

Alternatively
,
would
another
package
such
as
Kundera
be
able
to
connect
without
Cygwin
?

If
not
,
how
does
the
REST
API
compare
in
performance
to
the
native
Java
API
?

I
could
always
write
my
own
wrapper
for
that
and
distribute
it
to
our
developers
(
although
no
doubt
something
like
that
may
already
exist
)
.

Any
help
on
this
would
be
much
appreciated
as
I
'm
having
trouble
finding
a
definitive

I

First
I
believe
you
mean
D3
not
A3
,
since
PWM
does
not
exist
on
A3
.

Assuming
you
are
driving
a
DC
motor
,
and
not
something
like
a
servo
or
stepper

You
have
two
problems
.

1st
.

you
may
need
a
smoothing
capacitor
.

Where
your
formula
would
be
F
=
L*C
Noting
that
analogWrite
uses
a
F
=
490Hz
.

The
concept
is
simple
,
in
short
the
cap
average
out
the
high
and
lows
of
the
PWM
,
based
on
the
duty
cycle
.

And
the
capacitance
needed
is
based
on
the
frequency
and
impedance
.

This
will
provide
the
analog
voltage
.

2nd
.

And
bigger
problem
is
the
output
of
the
Arduino
can
not
supply
sufficient
current
to
drive
the
motor
correctly
.

It
will
max
out
at
about
20ma
,
and
the
motor
likely
needs
more
.

So
at
low
speeds
the
pulses
which
were
week
,
stall
out
during
their
low
periods
.

You
should
have
your
PWM
output
drive
a
transistor
,
which
in
turn
will
ON-OFF
the
motor
directly
from
the
power
supply
.

Now
your
motor
may
have
enough
inertia
as
not
to
need
the
cap
.

the

cap

You
're
loading
a
NIB
that
uses
a
10.7-specific
feature
,
Cocoa
Autolayout
,
on
10.6
,
which
does
n't
understand
it
.

If
you
wish
to
support
running
on
10.6
,
you
need
to
avoid
using
such
features
.

You
should
be
able
to
set
the
deployment
target
on
the
NIB
,
which
will
then
cause
warnings
to
show
up
for
features
which
are
n't
supported
by
that
deployment
target
.

Also
,
if
you
have
n't
already
done
so
,
you
need
to
do
something
similar
for
your
target
's
build
settings
.

Set
the
deployment
target
.

Unfortunately
,
that
wo
n't
necessarily
cause
warnings
for
code
which
uses
features
that
were
introduced
in
10.7
.

You
can
set
up
an
alternative
build
configuration
which
builds
against
the
10.6
SDK
and
compile
against
that
to
learn
where
you
're
using
post-10.6
features
.

The
MONGOHQ_URL
in
your
code
snippet
comes
from
the
shell
environment
.

For
example
,
in
bash
you
would
add
that
to
your
~
/.bash_profile
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3064
(
code
omitted

.
.
or
include
on
your
command
line
when
starting
the
node
app
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3065
(
code
omitted
for
annotation

Another
common
approach
with
Node.js
is
to
use
something
like
dotenv
,
which
will
load
environment
variables
from
a
.env
directory
in
your
project
.

There

you

I

far

follows

The
problem
I
have
is
this
.

If
I
add
a
return
false
;
to
the
onclick
=""
declaration
,
everything
works
fine
,
of
course
the
problem
there
is
that
click
does
not
take
the
user
to
the
intended
page
.

If
I
do
not
have
the
return
false
;
then
it
seems
like
the
ajax
call
is
never
executed
.

I
thought
the
onclick
event
should
execute
first
and
then
only
the
default
action
should
execute
.

Is
this
not
the
case
?

There
is
an
even
stranger
scenario
if
you
use
onmousedown
event
instead
.

It
seems
like
on
Firefox
,
if
you
use
the
onmousedown
event
,
once
you
go
to
the
new
page
,
you
cant
simply
navigate
back
to
the
old
page
,
you
have
to
refresh
the
old
page
.

Else
the
call
is
not
executed
.

This
does
not
happen
on
IE
.

OK
.
Found
an
answer
to
one
of
the
questions
:

The
inline
mootools
request
did
not
execute
when
declared
through
the
onclick()
.

It
seems
this
was
caused
by
the
script
not
being
synchronous
.

So
probably
it
returns
without
actually
fully
committing
the
request
,
and
the
browser
then
moves
to
another
page
breaking
the
execution
.

Adding
a
synchronous
call
to
the
script
fixes
the
problem
:

OP_BLOCK

The
second
problem
that
was
mentioned
on
the
onmousedownevent
,
i.e
.
firefox
not
executing
the
ajax
call
if
the
browser
navigates
back
is
still
unsolved

However
I
am
leaving
that
to

what
does
the
Any
means
in
this
context
?

and
I
got
something
interesting
,
weather
or
not
I
use
the
implemented
like
this

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_2392
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

and
the
output
in
the
iex
before
it
's
the
same
.

Does
that
means
this
implemented
does
nothing
?

Or
I
have
missed
something
?

I
know
what
's
my
confusing
.

I
also
get
started
with
example
this
site
.

Firstly
my
blank.ex
is

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2996
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

and
after
I
compile
it
elixirc
blank.ex
,
it
will
create
these
beam
files
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2997
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

and
secondly
my
blank.ex
is

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2998
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

and
I
compile
it
again
,
I
got
these
beam
files
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2999
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

It
does
n't
delete
the
Elixir.Blank.Integer.beam
Elixir.Blank.List.beam
files
,
and
when
I
run
in
iex
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3000
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

So
this
is
just
because
my
missing
of
deleting
the
older
beam
files
manually
.

Any

I
do
n't

why
you
're
getting
these
weird
results
,
but
I
suspect
you
have
some
incorrect
definitions
in

I
have
tried
with
the

from
the

CODE_BLOCK

And
got
expected

:

CODE_BLOCK

A_2994
(

The
last

is
a
fallback
to
Any

since
the

is
not

If
you
remove

you
should
get
an

You

make

by
clicking
on
the
header
divs
doing
like
that
:

CODE_BLOCK

A_4386

And
in
your

CODE_BLOCK

Doing
so
it
will
revert
the
sort
when
re-clicking
on
the
header
of
a
column
.

PS
:
do
n't
forget
to
dynamically
name
your

Modbus

If

then
it

probably
taking

When

you
have

Question_URL

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26096867/

the
following
question
may
seem
stupid
to
many
,
since
it
should
have
a
simple
solution
,
but
I
am
a
beginner
in
the
Spring
framework
,
and
I
have
been
searching
and
testing
many
methods
with
no
success
.

So
,
I
need
to
implement
logging
for
a
Web
Service
based
on
Spring
.

Maven
is
used
for
dependencies
,
with
the
spring-boot-starter-ws
dependency
,
and
not
the
whole
starter-web
starter
.

I
tried
with
log4j
,
by
adding
a
dependency
and
config
file
,
and
it
does
produce
a
log
file
,
but
only
for
the
initialization
of
the
logger
itself
,
and
no
logging
about
when
the
service
is
used
,
although
log4j
is
in
TRACE
level
.

I
also
tried
with
logback
,
by
adding
the
logback.xml
file
,
and
adding
the
starter-logging
dependency
,
but
that
also
creates
empty
log
files
with
nothing
on
them
.

In
the
Spring
boot
documentation
,
the
application.properties
file
is
mentioned
.

So
I
created
this
in
WEB-INF
,
and
put
the
logging.level.org.springframework
and
the
logging.path
entries
.

But
still
no
log
file
created
at
all
.

I
do
n't
want
to
log
my
own
messages
,
I
just
want
to
log
the
events
generated
by
Spring
itself
.

And
I
also
do
n't
have
a
main
method
,
only
an
Endpoint
for
the
web
service
,
if
any
of
these
might
be
relevant
.

So
what
I
need
is
the
simplest
possible
logging
,
possibly
without
adding
too
many
dependencies
or
so
,
and
retrieve
the
Spring
messages
into
the
log
.

Can
someone
tell
me
what
am
I
doing
wrong
?

Answer_to_Question_ID

logback
is
the
default
logging
implementation
used
by
Spring
Boot
(
I
assume
you
are
using
spring
boot
to
create
a
jar
and
run
that
!
)
.

Basicly
you
do
n't
need
to
do
anything
logging
is
already
handled
by
the
starter
you
included
.

There
is
a
default
logback.xml
shipped
with
Spring
which
turns
on
logging
,
for
the
spring
framework
this
is
on
INFO
.

If
you
want
to
override
this
simply
create
a
logback.xml
file
with
the
same
content
as
the
default
one
and
put
the
logger
for
spring
on
DEBUG
or
TRACE
.

Not
sure
if
you
really
want
to
put
everything
on
trace
unless
you
want
a
less
performant
application
.

As
to
what
you
are
doing
wrong
is
that
you
are
probably
doing
to
much
and
thinking
to
complex
.

Pig
uses
a

run
it

it
usually

Problem
:

I
want
to
use
a
different
size
scale
for
edges
and
nodes
in
a
network
created
with
the
ggnetwork
package
.

If
you
look
at
the
image
below
you
may
think
I
already
did
that
since
they
all
have
different
sizes
but
in
fact
edge
and
node
size
are
not
scaled
independently
in
this
plot
.

They
are
both
scaled
by
the
scale_size_area()
function
towards
the
same
maximum
(
30
)
.

If
I
get
larger
nodes
my
edges
will
shrink
.

I
guess
my
problem
boils
down
to
scaling
the
size
of
different
geoms
with
different
functions
.

So
for
example
how
can
I
scale
the
size
of
the
nodes
with
scale_size_area
(
max_size
=
30
)
and
the
size
of
the
edges
with
scale_size_continuous
(
range
=
c(1,6))
?

dual-scaling

The
other
answers
are
correct
-
however
this
implementation
of
the
Singleton
pattern
is
horribly
flawed
and
will
break
in
unexpected
ways
in
a
multi-threading
environment
.

The
easiest
way
is
not
to
have
lazy
initialization
of
the
singleton
,
if
you
really
must
have
lazy
initialization
then
do
it
using
a
static
holder
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2926
(
code

This
uses
the
class
loader
to
handle
all
the
lazy
initialization
,
thread
safety
,
etc
for
you
.

It
's
completely
thread
safe
and
fast
due
to
the
fact
that
it
does
n't
need
synchronization
or
null
checks
.

I
am
trying
to
implement
an
algorithm
for
process
histograms
images
using
multiple
threads
.

One
of
the
most
common
approach
is
to
split
multiple
thread
create
a
cache
buffer
on
each
one
,
do
the
histogram
on
the
cache
buffer
and
then
lock
a
mutex
addition
the
values
on
the
local
to
the
output
vector
,
and
unlock
the
buffer
.

This
approach
is
very
efficient
but
can
introduce
a
'
jam
'
.

I
mean
the
additions
of
the
datas
cannot
be
realized
concurently
.

In
most
of
the
case
when
the
range
of
the
values
is
quite
short
(
e.g
.
0-255
)
it
's
the
time
needed
to
proceed
the
addition
is
very
fast
and
can
be
neglect
.

If
the
range
of
datas
is
higher
like
for
example
on
thermal
images
this
time
can
become
more
significant
.

Thermal
images
are
often
matrix
of
unsigned
short
,
even
if
the
values
does
n't
use
the
full
range
(
0-65535
)
the
algorithm
must
process
all
the
range
.

In
order
to
speed
up
a
little
bit
hte
processing
I
thought
to
launch
a
background
thread
to
do
the
addition
while
the
"
foreground
"
thread
would
only
write
the
datas
into
a
preallocated
buffer
.

So
basically
the
work
of
a
"
foreground
"
thread
used
to
be
that
:

get
a
buffer
from
a
circular
buffer
.

process
the
histogram
for
a
specified
set
of
data
(
e.g
.
from
line
n
to
line
m
)
.

-notify
the
background
buffer
the
operations
are
finished
.

The
background
thread
used
to
do
:

wait
until
a
notification
arrive
and
check
if
the
number
of
available
buffer
is
lower
than
the
number
of
buffers
.

If
the
conditions
are
true
then
look
for
the
buffer
to
be
processed
from
the
buffers
available
.

Do
the
addition
with
the
output
buffer
.

make
the
processed
buffer
reusable
.

I
am
not
very
familiar
with
condition
variables
.

So
in
order
to
check
communication
between
the
threads
using
conditions
variable
I
wrote
the
following
toy
sample
:

toy.h

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_4329
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

main
.cpp

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_4330
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
code
as
is
use
to
work
without
difficulties
.

The
unwanted
aspect
of
the
code
is
written
on
the
method
background
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_4331
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

I
must
check
the
position
of
the
variable
"
it
"
otherwise
it
can
take
a
position
outside
of
the
buffer
size
.

The
way
I
thought
was
:

-
At
the
end
of
the
foreground
thread
a
notification
is
send
to
the
background
thread
.

-
Then
the
background
thread
process
the
buffers
(
or
the
buffers
depending
how
fast
the
threads
are
ending
)
.

-
At
the
end
the
background
thread
notify
to
the
next
foreground
thread
(
in
the
method
get_buffer())
it
has
finish
to
process
the
buffer
and
has
made
it
reusable
.

Following
these
statement
when
the
background
thread
is
looking
for
a
thread
it
use
to
find
it
between
Buf_start
and
_Buf_end
.

So
the
seeking
of
the
buffer
in
the
method
background
use
to
be
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_4332
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

After
several
hours
of
tests
I
have
no
idea
what
's
wrong
.

I
am
also
interested
to
know
if
this
algorithm
really
work
like
I
think
it
do
?

Is
there
any
more
efficient
,
less
processing
way
to
communicate
between
threads
?

I
fix
it
!

:)
.

I
identify
several
issues
from
the
class
"
toy
"
.

In
the
overload
of
the
operator
()
I
copy
past
the
code
of
the
method
get
buffer()
.

I
did
a
block
function
around
the
wait
condition
in
order
to
not
to
be
sequential
over
thread
.

The
unique_lock
needed
by
the
condition
variable
exist
only
between
the
brackets
of
the
block
function
,
like
this
when
the
wait
condition
has
been
evaluated
the
mutex
_mtx_foreground
is
unlock
.

Then
in
order
to
prevent
an
outbound
during
the
search
of
the
available
buffer
the
while
loop
has
been
replaced
by
a
for
loop
.

The
issue
was
on
the
condition
to
satisfy
for
increment
the
pointer
.

On
the
"
background
"
thread
I
add
a
loop
.

The
idea
is
that
:

The
background
thread
must
run
until
the
end
of
the
end
of
the
algorithm
.

The
background
thread
is
waiting
for
a
notification

from
one
of
the
foreground
thread
.

Look
for
a
buffer
to
process
,

process
it
,
remake
it
available
and
notify
it
to
the
foreground
thread
.

redo
until
all
the
buffers
are
processed
then
go
back
to
2)
.

Here
some

Note

To
include
HTML
partials
,
you
can
use
the
ng-include
directive
.

This
can
be
coupled
with
the
ng-controller
directive
in
a
few
different
ways
:

You
can
nest
an
element
with
ng-include
inside
an
ng-controller
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3355
(

You

include
an
ng-controller
directive
inside
an
included
partial
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3356
(
code

You
can
also
combine
ng-include
and
ng-controller
directives
on
the
same
element
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3357
(

Please
note
that
in
each
of
the
examples
above
,
the
string
literal
in
the
ng-include
directive
is
wrapped
in
single
quotes
-
this
is
because
the
directive
expects
an
expression
.

Depending
on
what
you
're
trying
to
accomplish
,
you
may
need
to
utilize
one
or
more
of
these
techniques
.

I
also
expect
you
'll
need
to
work
heavily
with
directives
(
for
example
,
you
can
use
the
UI
Bootstrap
modal
)
,
which
can
have
their
own

as
well
.

I

up
a

here
with
a

of
the

swapping
the

of
actually

I
'm

asking
which
is
more
costly
on
the

.

The
situation
is
that
I
have
about
40-400
particles
on
the

at
any
one
given
time
.

Each
particle
has
a
List
of
ParticleAI
which
have
an
Update()

that
returns
a
List
of
newly
created
Particle
objects
,
if
any
.

Now
,
since
this
game
is
being
made
for
mobile
,
efficiency
on
the
processor
is
key
.

I
was
wondering
if
it
is
more
costly
to
create
something
between
100-2000
Lists
every
frame
(
at
60FPS
)
which
may
be
empty
,
which
is
the
way
I
have
it
now
,
or
to
return

and
do
a

check
for
each

.

For
some
reason
,
in

it
seems
constructing
a
List
object
would
take
more
processor
time
than
simply
returning
a
null
and
then
doing
a
boolean
check
for
it
.

Am
I

my

practice
is
to
return
empty
,
but
I
am
not
making
this
game
for
anyone
else
to
edit
,
and
so
I
know
that
a
null
will
never
be
received
unexpectedly
.

I
need
to
know
in
pure
processing
terms
which
is
better
,
simply
because
of
the
sheer
number
of
particle
objects
being
created
at
once
.

Thanks
in
advance
!

EDIT
:

Just
realized
something
which
may
work
better
.

Would
it
be
a
better
idea
to
(
instead
of
creating
a
new
list
and
returning
it
for
every
particleAI
every
frame
)
create
each
particleAI
's
return
list
at
construction
and
then
clear
it
at
the
beginning
of
each
Update()
phase
?

That
almost
seems
like
it
would
be
the
best
option
.

As
objects
are
shared
,
reusing
the
same
list
object
will
not
do
.

Would
involve
copying
.

Null
or
empty
list
?

Assuming
you
want
to
read
from
and
write
to
the
list
,
null
seems
ugly
.

In
java
a
LinkedList
would
be
lighter
that
an
ArrayList
,
so
pick
a
linked
list
.

Null
would
be
faster
.

A
read-only
,
to-be-replaced
Collections.emptyList()
would
be
a
bit
safer
.

Instead
of
the
data
structure
of

it
might
be
worthwile
considering
the

approach

I
recently
found
out
that
there
are
two
types
of
LayoutManager
you
can
use
in
working
with
RecyclerView
,
one
from
native
Android
and
one
from
Leanback
library
.

I
need
to
use
the
one
from

in
order
to
be
able
to
maintain
the
position
of
the
focused
element
fixed
in
the
middle
of
the

.

The
problem
is
I
need
to
set
this
layout
to
stack
from
end
so
the
direction
would
be
to
scroll
to
left
,
not
the
default
right
scrolling
.

In
the
native
library
,
there
are
two
methods
I
can
use
to

this
,
setStackFromEnd(true)
or
setReverseLayout(true)
.

Is
there

I

the

what

A

That

require

You

The

the

you

it

Unfortunately

Java

I

the
best
you

do
is
use

It
works
fine
for
me
.

I
think
part
of
the
problem
is
that
your
reading
it
too
literally
.

That
's
not
your
fault
;
the
instructions
do
n't
explain
its
own
syntax
very
well
.

Here
's
what
I
did
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5098
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Notice
how
I
did
n't
just
write
"
alias.<alias>
"
or
the
like
.

The
whole
purpose
of
the
config
command
is
to
actually
configure
how
git
works
.

The
point
of
alias
is
to
give
all
your
commands
like
config
,
help
,
init
,
etc
.
new
ways
to
be
called
upon
.

In
the
above
example
,
I
typed
right
next
to
"
alias
.
"
what
I
wanted
the
NEW
command
to
be
,
and
a
space
away
on
the
right
where
it
says
"
help
"
I
refer
to
the
command
I
want
to
make
an
alias
for
.

I
'm
basically
changing
the
"
help
"
command
so
I
can
use
it
just
by
typing
"
hp
"
.

You
can
literally
make
it
anything
you
want
.

I
could
use
code
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5099
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

and
I
can
write
IMABigBaboon
instead
of
init
and
it
will
work
.

Try
it
!

Just
be
careful
you
do
n't
name
two
commands
the
same
thing
.

Otherwise
you
wind
up
changing
the
name
of
the
previous
alias
.

Remember
;
you
can
only
have
one
alias
for
one
command
!

My
question
is
:
Which
is
better
between
using
NotificationCenter
and

Closures
to
communicate
between
two
instances
?

If
they
are
similar
,
what
should
I
use
?

Hopefully
,
this

If

Why
do

have

Why
do
not
they
send
a
notification
with
Data
,
Response
,
and
Error
inside
it
?

I
know
the
difference
between
them
,
I
just
do
n't
know
in
what
situations
should
I
use
each
one
.

Answer_to_Question_ID
:
41944911

Question_URL
:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41944911/

In
some
cases
the
patterns
are
interchangeable
,
however
:

Using
a
closure
is
the
simplest
solution
for
simple
cases

Using
a
delegate
is
common
when
there
is
complex
communication
between
two
objects
.

One
delegate
can
be
better
than
many
closures
.

You
have
to
use
notifications
when
you
have
multiple
observers
or
when
you
are
not
sure
what
objects
will
be
observing
.

You
might
be
asking
yourself
why
we
are
using
closures
for
simple
cases
and
not
delegates
or
notifications
.

The
answer
is
that
closures
are
the
most
lightweight
.

They
are
easy
to
create
and
they
positively
affect
your
code
quality
.

Let
's
consider
a
completion
callback
.

If
you
decide
to
use
a
notification
,
you
need
another
method
that
will
handle
that
notification
.

The
same
is
valid
for
delegates
.

If
you
need
some
context
(
e.g
.
the
parameters
that
triggered
the
actions
)
,
you
will
need
to
save
it
into
a
property
.

On
the
other
hand
,
a
closure
can
be
created
inline
.

That
means
that
the
code
that
triggers
the
action
and
handles
its
result
is
at
one
place
.

This
really
simplifies
the
structure
of
your
code
.

Also
note
that
if
the
closure
needs
some
context
,
it
can
capture
it
,
without
the
need
to
create
an
additional
property
.

So
the
only
variables

exist

post
become
$_POST['field_name_1']

.

You

confirm

to

You

The
reason
this
would
happen
is
that
your
email
string
,
for
some
reason
,
did
not
have
an
'
@
'
symbol
in
it
.

This
leads
email.split("@")
to
result
in
a
list
of
length
1
,
rather
than
a
list
of
length
2
,
as
you
were
expecting
.

My
guess
is
that
you
have
a
blank
email
somewhere
,
but
any
email
field
that
does
n't
have
an
'
@
'
symbol
will
cause
this
exception
to
be
raised
.

Not
without
importing
at
all
,
I
dont
think
so
.

However
you
have
other
options
.

You
could
import
your
SQL
dump
into
a
temporary
memory-only
database
,
then
query
that
database
.

For
instance
this
could
be
an
SQLite
:MEMORY
:
database
if
your
sql
is
compatible
,
or
you
could
use
Engine
=
MEMORY
(
or
Engine
=
HEAP
for
older
versions
)
with
MySQL
"
create
table
"
DDL
to
create
a
memory
table
,
and
then
query
that
db
(
You
would
have
to
replace
Engine
=
INNODB
or
Engine
=
MyISAM
with
MEMORY
in
your
dump
file
to
import
it
)
.

Same
idea
.

Obviously
,
this
depends
on
size
of
your
data
you
want
to
query
.

a
1TB
Database
would
probably
prove
impractical
to
import
into
RAM

I

your

is
in
the
declaration
of
that

:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4445
(

int
&
is
a
reference
to
an
int
,
i.e
.
an
int
you
give
to
the

,
the

will
change
it

and
your

will
reflect
the
changes

So
maybe
you

it

passing

which
can

it

I

implemented
an

system
in
my

,
that
generates
an
ical
attachment
that
is
sent
to
the
appropriate

.

Is
it
possible
to
add
a

in
the

that
would
trigger
the
processing
of
the

?

(
in

This

that
for

in

it
's
not
possible
.

Is
it
still
the

for

attachments
?

using

this

to
be

Dealt
with
this
problem
several
years
ago
and
there
was
no
way
you
could
force
most
email
client
to
"
process
"
(
trigger
"
Add
to
calendar
"
menu
)
.

However
,
what
you
want
is
just
make
some
element
in
your
email
trigger
that
.

You
can
do
this
by
simply
linking
that
element
to
.ical
file
on
your
server
.

The
advantage
is
that
you
can
attache
some
parameters
to
your
link
and
generate
that
event
file
dynamically
.

Also
,
it
scales
pretty
well
.

I
am
using
standard
GWT
(
2.0.1
)
to
make
an
internet
app
and
i
have
this
wierd
issue
with
huge
fonts
(
edit
:
well
,
larger
than
normal
)
with
the
default
style
in
IE
7
&
8
,
while
FF
,
Chrome
and
Safari
are
displaying
fonts
correctly
.

At
first
i
thought
it
must
be
on
error
on
my
side
(
i
use
UiBinder
with
some
custom
css
)
but
then
I
noticed
that
on
the
GWT
showcases
site
the
various
widget
fonts
are
also
too
big
.

Any
ideas
?

Answer_to_Question_ID

Question_URL

This
is
due
to
IE
default
font
size
rendering
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
GWT
but
rather
with
CSS
styling
.

You
can
ensure
that
fonts
are
consistent
over
multiple
browser
with
a
CSS
like
that
(
for
instance
)
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_235
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

EDIT
:

To
ensure
all
widgets
"
get
"
this
new
style
you
need
to
put
your
CSS
file
in
the
*
.gwt.xml
file
in
the
following
way
(
the
order
of
lines
is
important
)
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_236
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

do
n't
put
it
in
the
HTML
page
!

This
will
ensure
that
your
style
override
the
widget
styles
.

PS
:
You
might
override
some
widget
styles
by
hand
(
I
have
a
GwtOverride.css
for
that
purpose
)
..

A
quick
comparison
between

6

3.6
(
all
on
WinXP
SP

-
Opera

show
slightly
larger

.

I
'm
not
sure
if
that
's
GWT
's
fault
-
every

has
some
core

if
no
additional

styles
are

,
so
just
make
sure
you
set

your

nullify

.

That
is
,
unless

it

As
long
as
there
is
an
owner
relation
between
two
windows
.

the
owner
of
a
window
can
never
be
on
top
of
the
owned
window
.

Windows
in
an
owner
,
parent
,
child
relation
always
behave
the
same
.

The
owned/child
window
is
always
on
top
of
the
parent/owner
.

If
you
want
to
break
this
,
you
have
to
break
the
owner/child
relation
.

Let
all
dialog
windows
have
no
owner
..
.
than
they
may
float
freely
.

But
:
I
will
expect
the
you
program
does
n't
behave
better
.

Even
worse
.

User
might
search
windows
that
are
deep
below
covered
under
other
windows
.

And
they
will
never
get
in
front
,
when
your
program
gets
active
.

See
the
description
about
parent/child/owned
windows
here
.

Also
this
article
might
be
helpful
.

Edit
:
The
problem
is
that
internally
the
MFC
sets
the
main
window
as
an
owner
if
no
parent
is
given
.

Only
the
call
to
BOOL
Wnd
::
CreateDlgIndirect(LPCDLGTEMPLATE
lpDialogTemplate
,
CWnd
*
pParentWnd
,
HINSTANCE
hInst
)
allows
to
leave
pParentWnd
NULL
.

So
you
may
create
the
window
as
normal
,
but
use
SetParent(NULL)
after
it
was
created
.

Again
the
MFC
ASSERTs
this
.

SO
you
may
use
the
API
function
and
the
handle
of
your

You
need
a
data
structure
like
a
Map
to
map
between
your
checkboxes
and
the
tables
..
.

I
usually
work
with
SWT
and
you
have
a
map
in
each
GUI
component
to
store
whatever
you
want
,
but
as
far
as
I
know
,
you
do
n't
have
this
in
awt
,
so
you
need
to
do
this
manually
..
.
(
I
assume
you
are
using
awt
,
although
CheckBox
class
in
awt
is
actually
Checkbox
not
CheckBox
!!
!
)

Bottom
line
is
,
you
need
to
bind
some
data
to
your
GUI
components
so
you
can
recognize
them
later
in
your
code
..
.

I
would
use

EDIT
:

IIUC
,
you
have
a
similarity
formula
per
field
,
and
you
want
to
use
it
per
document
,
running
against
all
other
documents
.

You
can
use
several
options
,
all
at
indexing
time
:

Extend
the
DefaultSimilarity
class
.

Extend
the
SimilarityDelegator
class
,
if
you
only
need
to
modify
part
of
the
methods
.

In
both
methods
,
you
may
make
use
of
payloads
to
store
term-specific
information
(
could
be
useful
for
the
lat-long
data
)
.

After
implementing
a
Similarity
class
using
one
of
these
methods
,
use
Similarity.setDefault(mySimilarity)
to
set
this
as
the
Similarity
instance
for
indexing
and
searching
.

Only
then
index
your
text
corpus
,
which
you
can
search
later
-
you
will
probably
have
to
extend
the
Searcher
class
as
well
to
get
the
raw
similarity
.

Having
said
that
,
I
believe
this
approach
is
wrong
for
your
use
case
-
Lucene
is
optimized
to
get
a
few
similar
documents
,
not
a
score
for
every
one
,
so
I
predict
the
runtime
will
be
prohibitive
-
Hope
I
am
wrong
,
but
nevertheless
I
suggest
you
read
Mining
of
Massive
Datasets
for
a
better
approach
-
min
hashes
and
shingling
.

Good
luck
.

Patrick
,
I
will
first
quote
Grant
Ingersoll
about
modifying
the
Similarity
class
:
"
Here
be
Dragons
"
.

Customizing
Lucene
's
Similarity
class
is
hard
.

I
have
done
this
.

It
is
not
fun
.

Only
do
this
if
you
absolutely
have
to
.

I
suggest
you
should
first
read
Grant
's
spatial
search
paper
,
his
findability
paper
and
his
'
debugging
relevance
'
paper
.

These
show
other
ways
to
get

If

you

Typically
the
Memento
pattern
is
used
to
implement
roll-back/save
point
support
.

For
example
I
might
want
to
mark
the
state
of
an
object
at
a
point
in
time
,
do
some
work
and
then
decide
to
revert
that
object
back
to
the
point
at
which
is
was
marked
.

The
implementation
of
a
Memento
pattern
could
use
serialisation
,
which
would
involve
saving
the
contents
of
the
object
into
a
byte[]
and
keeping
in
memory
or
writing
to
disk
.

When
reverting
the
content
of
the
object
would
be
rebuilt
from
the
serialised
copy
.

Conversely
I
could
implement
a
Memento
pattern
by
cloning
the
object
in
memory
and
keeping
a
reference
to
the
copy
and
then
copying
the
state
back
if
the
object
needs
reverting
.

This
method
does
n't
use
serialisation
.

The

an

It

Serialization

the
process
of
transforming

I
have
different
<select>

a
ng-repeat
div
.

What
I
want
is
to
avoid
users
select
several
times
a
same

.

I
used
the
filter
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK

The
filter
works
like
I
want
(
I
tested
it
separately

.

But
the
result
is
not
good

When
the
filter
is
active
,
options
in
different
select
have
to
show
only

it

I
found
that
std::condition_variable
is
very
difficult
to
use
due
to
spurious
wakeups
.

So
sometimes
I
need
to
set
a
flags
such
as
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_1633
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

I
set
is_ready
to
true
before
I
call
notify
(
notify_one()
or
notify_all())
,
and
then
I
wait
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_1634
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Is
there
any
reason
that
I
should
n't
just
do
this
:
(
Edit
:
Ok
,
this
is
really
a
bad
idea
.
)

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_1635
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

And
if
condition_variable
had
chosen
a
waiting
duration
(
I
do
n't
know
whether
this
is
true
or
not
)
,
I
prefer
choose
it
myself
.

The
purpose
of
std::condition_variable
is
to
wait
for
some
condition
to
become
true
.

It
is
not
designed
to
be
just
a
receiver
of
a
notify
.

You
might
use
it
,
for
example
,
when
a
consumer
thread
needs
to
wait
for
a
queue
to
become
non-empty
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2114
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
consumer
(
get_from_queue
)
is
not
waiting
for
the
condition
variable
,
they
are
waiting
for
the
condition
the_queue.empty()
.

The
condition
variable
gives
you
the
way
to
put
them
to
sleep
while
they
are
waiting
,
simultaneously
releasing
the
mutex
and
doing
so
in
a
way
that
avoids
race
conditions
where
you
miss
wake
ups
.

The
condition
you
are
waiting
on
should
be
protected
by
a
mutex
(
the
one
you
release
when
you
wait
on
the
condition
variable
.
)

This
means
that
the
condition
rarely
(
if
ever
)
needs
to
be
an
atomic
.

You
are
always
accessing
it
from
within
a
mutex
.

Answer_to_Question_ID

Question_URL

You
can
code
this
either
way
:

Using
atomics
and
a
polling
loop
.

Using
a
condition_variable
.

I
've
coded
it
both
ways
for
you
below
.

On
my
system
I
can
monitor
in
real
time
how
much
cpu
any
given
process
is
using
.

First
with
the
polling
loop
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2115
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

For
me
this
takes
30
seconds
to
execute
,
and
while
executing
the
process
takes
about
99.6
%
of
a
cpu
.

Alternatively
with
a
condition_variable
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2116
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
has
the
exact
same
behavior
except
that
during
the
30
second
execution
,
the
process
is
taking
0.0
%
cpu
.

If
you
're
writing
an
app
that
might
execute
on
a
battery
powered
device
,
the
latter
is
nearly
infinitely
easier
on
the
battery
.

Now
admittedly
,
if
you
had
a
very
poor
implementation
of
std::condition_variable
,
it
could
have
the
same
inefficiency
as
the
polling
loop
.

However
in
practice
such
a
vendor
ought
to
go
out
of
business
fairly
quickly
.

Update

For
grins
I
augmented
my
condition_variable
wait
loop
with
a
spurious
wakeup
detector
.

I
ran
it
again
,
and
it
did
not
print
out
anything
.

Not
one
spurious
wakeup
.

That
is
of
course
not
guaranteed
.

But
it
does
demonstrate
what
a
quality
implementation
can
achieve
.

Question_URL

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36272581/

A
little
preamble
:
Knockback
puts
the
model
in
MVVM
,
where
Knockout
is
really
just
VVM
.

Knockback
also
gives
you
some
automatic
synchronization
between
them
,
which
is
nice
.

But
you
still
need
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
model
and
the
viewmodel
are
two
different
pieces
of
your
app
.

The
viewmodel
is
n't
just
a
Knockout
copy
of
the
Bootstrap
model
.

Do
n't
put
viewmodel
pieces
in
the
model
.

So
you
need
to
decide
whether
validation
is
a
viewmodel
behavior
or
a
model
behavior
.

I
say
viewmodel
,
because
you
want
to
use
it
in
the
view
.

So
remove
it
from
the
model
and
define
a
computed
.

However
,
if
you
wanted
it
to
be
part
of
the
model
,
you
would
want
to
define
an
attribute
,
not
just
a
method
,
and
a
model
event
handler
that
would
update
the
attribute
on
change
.

Knockback
will
dutifully
copy
the
attribute
into
the
viewmodel
,
and
you
can
use
it
there
.

Overview

I

The

can
run

Problem
:

We
've
had

in
the

where
a

has
tried
to
run
a
query
,
and
found
that
it
has
failed
because
their

profile
has
been

(
on

,
the

are
provided

.

Security
on
the

can
specify
that
a

this
is
having
the
knock-on
effect
of
disabling
their
profile
.

On
further
inspection
,
when
I
've
inspected
the
logs
on
the
server
(
while
debugging
line
by
line
)
,
I
've
found
that
the
query
is
submitted
to
the
server
when
you
call
TADOQuery.sql.add()
,
and
again
when
the
TADOQuery
's
active
propery
is
set
to
true
(
which
is
the
point
at
which
I
would
expect
the
query
to
be
submitted
to
the
server
)
.

Here
's
an
example
of
the
code
that
I
'm
using
to
run
the
query
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_525
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

My
question
is
therefore
quite
simple
:

1
.
Why
does
the
TADOQuery.sql.add()
method
submit
the
query
(
when
it
should
just
be
adding
the
sql
to
the
TADOQuery
's
sql
property
)
?

2
.
What
can
I
do
to
prevent
this
?

i.e
.
is
there
any
way
to
prevent
the
sql
being
submitted
when
I
call
the
add()
method
?

For
those
of
you
that
would
like
extra
information
about
the
logs
,
the
exit
point
logs
on
the
IBM
i
show
that
when
I
call
adoqry.sql.add
in
the
above
example
,
the
query
is
run
through
the
"
Database
Server-SQL
Requests
"
exit
point
application
,
via
function
"
Prepare
and
Describe
"
.

When
I
call
adoqry.active
:=
true
in
the
above
example
,
the
same
query
goes
through
the
same
exit
point
application
,
but
via
the
"
Open/Describe
"
function
.

If
you
're
not
familiar
with
the
IBM
i
,
do
n't
worry
about
it
-
I
'm
just
including
that
information
as
proof
that
I
have
traced
the
query
being
submitted
twice
.

The
real
issue
is
with
the
TADOQuery
's
sql.add()
processing
.

From
your
description
of
your
problem
,
I
assume
you
specify
the
ConnectionString
of
the
ADOQuery
.

Doing
this
combines
the
database
login
with
the
running
of
the
query
.

You
have
found
that
this
has
undesirable
side
effects
when
the
user
's
credentials
are
invalid
.

Separate
the
database
login
from
the
query
by
using
an
ADOConnection
.

Specify
the
ConnectionString
of
the
ADOConnection
and
assign
the
ADOConnection
to
the
ADOQuery.Connection
property
.

This
way
,
you
control
the
database
login
and
can
catch
logins
with
bad
credentials
.

Additionally
the
ADOConnection.Open
method
allows
you
to
specify
the
username
and
password
so
you
do
not
have
to
put
them
in
the
ConnectionString
.

While
this
does
not
answer
you
specific
questions
,
this
approach
will
help
you
solve
the
problem
of
the
user
's
profile
being
disabled
by
separating
the
login
from
the
running
of
the
query
.

On
the
page
87
of
the
Game
Boy
CPU
Manual
it
is
claimed
that
the
CP
n
instruction
sets
the
carry
flag
when
there
was
no
borrow
and
that
it
means
that
A
<
n
.

This
seems
to
conflict
itself
,
because
the
carry
flag
is
set
when
A
>
n
.

An
example
:
If
A
=
0
and
B
=
1
,
CP
B
sets
the
flags
like
SUB
A
,
B
,
which
is
0
-
1
.

This
becomes
0
+
255
=
255
and
the
carry
flag
is
not
set
,
even
though
A
<
B
.

I
came
across
this
same
issue
in
other
Z80
documents
as
well
,
so
I
do
n't
believe
this
is
a
typo
.

Am
I
misunderstanding
how
borrow
and
SUB
work
or
is
there
something
else
going
on
?

Is
SUB
not
equal
to
ADD
with
two

in
terms
of
flags
?

If

A

You

add
the

filter
for
your
own
broadcasts
.

Just
register
the
service
for
that
broadcasts
with
registerReceiver()
when
the
service
is
started
.

Note
,
that
you
have
to
start
the

your
App
starts

for

in

should

am
a
newbie
to
Objective-C
and
I
am
working
on
getting
a
good
handle
in
working
with
arrays
.

According
to
Apples
own
documentation
NSMutableArray
inherits
from
NSArray
.

I
am
seeking
to
use
the
method
objectAtIndex:i
within
a
for
loop
.

Yet
Xcode
is
claiming
that

OP_BLOCK
:
(
output
omitted
for
annotation
)

Within
a
for
loop
I
am
performing
(
or
seeking
to
)
the
following
test
:

OP_BLOCK
:
(
output
omitted
for
annotation
)

I
am
certain
I
not
doing
this
right
.

It
can
be
frustrating
learning
the
idiosyncrasies
of
a
new
programming
language
.

For
me
Objective
C
has
,
so
far
,
borne
little
resemblance
to
C++
or
C
.

Any
pointer
or
assistance
would
be
greatly
appreciated
.

Thanks
in
advance

From
your
error
message
,
you
could
not
be
using
the
method
and
parameter
correctly
.

Possibly
you
're
trying
to
use
a
dot
notation
?

Your
code
should
be
like
:

CODE_BLOCK

where
the

comes
from
your

and
you
then

you

You

to
call
the

In

It
's
dangerously
unsafe
(
undefined
behavior
)
to
return
a
pointer
to
a
stack
variable
.

That
includes
arrays
allocated
on
the
stack
.

The
memory
occupied
by
a

variable
is
essentially
deallocated
as
soon
as
the

returns
.

By

the

another

Sorry
I
will
rewrite
the
question
hoping
to
be
clear
.

In
my
.cpp
code
I
create
a
list
of
quads
,
a
few
of
them
have
a
flag
,
in
the
pixel
shader
I
check
if
this
flag
is
set
or
not
,
if
the
flag
is
not
set
,
the
quad
gets
colored
in
red
for
example
,
if
the
flag
is
set
,
I
want
to
decide
the
color
of
every
single
pixel
,
so
if
I
need
to
colour
half
of
the
flagged
quad
in
red
and
the
other
half
in
blue
I
can
simply
do
something
like
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_1133
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

In
this
way
I
can
get
half
of
the
quad
colored
in
blue
and
another
half
colored
in
red
,
or
I
can
decide
where
to
put
the
red
color
or
where
to
put
the
blue
one
.

Imagine
I
've
got
a
quad
50x50
pixels

[
frag
]

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_1134
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

In
this
case
I
would
expect
that
a
quad
with
the
flag
set
will
get
two
colors
per
face
.

I
hope
I
have
been
more
specific
now
.

thanks
.

Just
to
add
something
I
ca
n't
use
any
texture
.

Ok
i
do
this
now
:

Every
quad
has
4
textures
coordinated
(
0
,
0
)
,
(
0
,
1)
,
(
1
,
1)
,
(
1
,
0
)
;

I
enable
the
texture
coordinates
using
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_1135
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

[
vert
]

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_1136
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

[
frag
]

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_1137
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

I
get
always
the
yellow
color
so
x1
=
1
and
x2
=
1
almost
always
and
some
quad
is
yellow/green
.

I
would
expect
that
the
texture
coordinates
change
in
the
fragment
shader
and
so
I
should
get
a
gradient
,
am
I
wrong
?

In
addition
to
Chris
Dodd
's
answer
,
you
can
also
access
the
screen-space
coordinate
(
in
pixels
,
though
actually
pixel
centers
and
thus
?
.
5)
of
the
currently
processed
fragment
through
the
special
fragment
shader
variable
gl_FragCoord
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_1555
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

But
this
gives
you
the
position
of
the
fragment
in
screen-space
and
thus
relative
to
the
lower
left
corner
of
you
viewport
.

If
you
actually
need
to
know
the
position
inside
the
individual
quad
(
which
makes
more
sense
if
you
want
to
actually
color
each
quad
half-by-half
,
since
the
"
half-cut
"
would
otherwise
vary
with
the
quad
's
position
)
,
then
Chris
Dodd
's
answer
is
the
correct
approach
.

Question_URL

If
you
want
to
know
the
coordinate
within
the
quad
,
you
need
to
calculate
it
yourself
.

In
order
to
that
,
you
'll
need
to
create
a
new
interpolant
(
call
it
something
like
vec2
quadCoord
)
,
and
set
it
appropriately
for
each
vertex
,
which
means
you
'll
likely
also
need
to
add
it
as
an
attribute
and
pass
it
through
your
vertex
shader
.

eg
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_1554
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

You
'll
need
to
feed
in
this
attribute
in
your
drawing
code
when
drawing
your
quads
.

For
each
quad
,
the
vertexes
will
have
likely
have
quadCoordIn
values
of
(
0
,
0
)
,
(
0
,
1)
,
(
1
,
1)
and
(
1
,
0
)
-
-
you
could
use
some
other
coordinate
system
if
you
prefer
,
but
this
is
the
easiest
.

Then
,
in
your
fragment
program
,
you
can
access
quadCoord.xy
to
determine
where
in
the
quad
you
are
.

Your
suggestion
sounds
good
to
me
.

If
the
file
format
is
really
so
predictable
,
any
more
sophisticated
approaches
might
just
be
overkill
in
my
opinion
.

But
if
you
want
to
see
a
different
approach
,
this
is
my
idea
:
Every
line
that
does
not
start
with
an
%
is
something
we
want
to
parse
to
an
ArrayList
.

So
,
whenever
you
come
across
a
line
that
is
not
a
comment
,
you
start
parsing
the
following
lines
to
an
ArrayList
until
you
either
hit
another
comment
or
the
end
of
the
file
.

Both
options
mark
the
end
of
the
part
that
you
want
to
store
in
one
single
ArrayList
.

So
,
something
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3117
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

where
lineIsComment
(
String
line
)
returns
a
boolean
that
indicates
whether
the
given
line
is
a
comment
,
and
addToList
(
String
line
,
ArrayList
<Integer>
list
)
uses
your
method
to
parse
a
line
of
numbers
and
stores
them
in
the
provided
list
.

I
have
a
use

the

leaf

.

The

it

load
event

I
have
tried
node.rendered

I

their
is
an

which

fired

(
like

.

PS
:
I
have
tried
the

Pretty

Removing
a
display
object
from
the
display
list
,
does
n't
stop
the
animation
or
remove
it
from
memory
.

It
just
removes
it
from
the
display
list
.

Yes
,
you
need
to
stop
the
animation
and
remove
any
event
listeners
that
might
be
active
for
that
object
.

A
display
object
is
never
truly
gone
until
it
is
garbage
collected
.

But
that
will
not
happen
until
no
references
to
that
object
remain
.

So
if
you
have
a
variable
called
explosion
that
references
your
display
object
,
you
need
to
set
it
to
null
after
removing
it
from
the
display
list
:

Keep
in
mind
that
this
does
n't
immediately
remove
the
object
from
memory
,
it
just
makes
it
fair
game
for
the
garbage
collector
.

You
can
google
"

to
get

It
's
not
a
good
idea
.

Instead
,
always
map
the
full
class
and
create
smaller
ones
that
you
can
project
on
using
Transformers.AliasToBean
or
LINQ
.

An
example
of
the
latter
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_241
(

This
will
only
select
those
three
fields
from
the
DB
,
even
when
filtering
by
a
different
one
.

It
's
worth
noting
that
,
with
LINQ
,
you
could
also
use
an
anonymous
type
to
select
any
projection
you
want
without
creating
additional
types
or
mappings
.

With

I

why
?

The

creating
just
one

,
despite
the

All
the
images
are
getting
the
same
filename
because
the
code
runs
fast
enough
such
that
the
time()
function
(
which
returns
the
time
in
seconds
)
is
giving
you
the
same
value
4
times
.

So
you
're
overwriting
the
same
file
4
times
in
this
line
:

As

you
can
append
a

I
'm
using
jQuery
validation
in
order
to
sort
banners
on
a
website
.

I
have
three
types
of
banners
:

Default
Banner
(
set
by
the
company
,
existing
rule
cannot
be
removed
but
can
be
sorted
)

Selectable
Banner
(
selectable
banner
form
a
list
of
many
)

Special
Banner
(
special
banner
,
set
by
the
company
difference
between
this
and
default
is
that
they
can
be
removed
from
the
carousel
)

The
banners
carousel
has
a
few
rules
no
more
than
7
banners
are
allowed
into
the
carousel
and
four
of
these
can
be
custom
,
with
the
four
of
these
being
selectablebanners
.

I
've
got
the
logic
for
this
as
follows
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_2731
(

Another
rule
I
have
in
place
is
that
a
default
banner
cannot
be
removed
but
it
can
be
sorted
.

I
've
implemented
this
as
so
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_2732
(

}
)
;

However
I
would
like
to
amend
this
slightly
but
have
no
idea
how
to
begin
with
this
logic
as
it
is
slightly
more
advanced
.

The
rule
I
want
to
implement
is
that
if
there
are
2
or
more
"
selectedbanners
"
in
ul
#sortable1
then
the
default
banners
can
be
removed
.

However
if
only
for
example
there
is
a
single
defaultbanner
and
a
single
selectablebanner
.

Then
I
would
like
my
previous
validation
to
apply
which
is
that
a
default
banner
cannot
be
removed
.

Can
someone
please
help
me
to
solve
this
problem
.

Imagine
a

with

at
known

Most
are
clustered
close
together
,
but
some
are
outliers
,
and
there
are
large
areas
where
there
are
no
points
at
all
.

I
have
multiple
clients
who
can
view
the
plane
through
rectangular
viewports
.

Each
client
's
viewport
may
be
of
different
dimensions
,
and
can
be
moved
instantly
to
any
location
on
the
plane
.

The
clients
do
not
know
the
locations
of
the
points
;
only
the
server
does
.

When
a
client
connects
,
it
will
communicate
the
size
of
its
viewport
to
the
server
,
and
the
server
should
respond
with
a
location
where
one

The

collects

sends

.

This
continues
until
all

have
been
visited
by
at

one
client
.

I
need
an
efficient
algorithm
that
will
choose
the

to
visit
.

An

will
minimize
the
number
of
locations
that

need
to
visit
by
including
as
many

a

location

minimizing
duplicate

not
visiting

with
no

Can

I
have
2
FileHandlers
that
write
out
to
two
separate
files
,
and
the
amount
of
I/O
occurring
is
slowing
down
my
application
quite
a
bit
:

I
've
decided
to
have
the
FileHandlers
run
on
separate
threads
.

As
they
are
on
separate
threads
,
I
needed
a
concept
of
a
"
queue
"
,
so
that
these
separate
threads
can
poll
this
queue
and
print
out
any
incoming
messages
.

I
've
preformatted
messages
so
that
any
arguments
used
do
not
change
before
they
actually
reach
the
print
out
in
the
FileHandler
.

Now
I
've
realised
that
I
ca
n't
use
the
"
log
"
methods
provided
by
the
logger
,
as
that
attempts
to
invoke
methods
on
the
current
thread
to
format
and
print
out
the
messages
.

So
I
simply
call
a
method
that
adds
my
trace
message
to
the
queue
.

I
then
use
run()
method
of
the
FileHandlers
to
print
out
the
messages
using
publish()
.

I
now
realise
publish()
only
takes
in
a
LogRecord
,
which
is
just
a
level
+
message
.

My
traces
have
much
more
,
which
ca
n't
simply
be
placed
in
an
overall
message
,
I
want
to
be
able
to
use
the
"
Formatter
"
that
I
've
set
to
the
FileHandler
.

So
I
create
an
instance
of
the
logger
in
the
FileHandler
,
so
I
can
use
the
log
method
and
format
the
string
as
designed
in
the
Formatter
.

Which
works
,
kinda
.

..
.

This
is
getting
a
bit
silly
,
is
it
worth
continuing
on
like
this
,
working
AROUND
the
java.util.Logger
rather
than
working
with
it
?

One
of
the
useful
parts
of
the
java.util.Logger
is
having
a
separate
logger
instance
for
each
class
and
being
able
to
have
more
control
over
the
messages
..
.

Any
suggestions
?

The
code
is
quite
long
,
but
I
think
it
's
easily
understood
from
the
description
above

not

You
should
really
consider
using

.

These
issues
you
are
describing
come
along
with
rolling
your
own
logger
.

SLF4J
is
really
commonly
used
because
it
is
not
very
intrusive
,
should
you
decide
that
you

something
different
you

a

http://saltnlight5.blogspot.ca/2013/08/how-to-configure-slf4j-with-different.html

http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html

If
you
do
decide
to
stick
with
your
own
logger
I
would
say
that
you
should
start
by
making
it
a
singleton
with
several
logwriters
attached
to
log
levels
,
you
then
setup
a
non-blocking
queue
for
each
logger
(
there
are
tons
of
examples
of
this
out
there
)
and
simply
call
log(logLevel,
logOrigin,
logMessage)
and
under
the
hood
send
this
to
each
logwriter
,
which
would
be
a
non-blocking
queue
that
runs
on
a
thread
for
each
logwriter
.

Each
logwriter
should
be
it
's
own
thread
,
not
each
log
,
and
you
only
need
one
logger
as
all
it
is
is
a
short
hand
to
place
things
in
your
logwriter
's
queues
from
anywhere
in

The
graph
and
AVReader
underpinnings
are
not
connected/linked
whatsoever
.

The
confusion
perhaps
comes
from
that
iOS
wo
n't
"
background
"
(
hibernate
)
a
process
if
it
sees
the
audio
graph
running
(
because
then
audio
data
would
be
unable
to
be
generated
)
.

That
's
why
when
you
stop
the
audio
graph
,
2-3
minutes
later
,
iOS
will
background
your
process
(
as
of
iOS
9
)
.

Presumably
,
iOS
looks
at
what
's
going
on
in
your
process
and
decides
when
your
process
should
be
forced
to
background
(
via
beginBackgroundTaskWithName:expirationHandler
)
.

Apple
devs
decided
for
whatever
reason
to
make
AVReader
stop
when
put
into
background
mode
(
my
best
guess
is
QA
)
.

The
good
news
is
that
you
can
detect
it
and
recover
when
your
process
exits
background
mode
,
but
you
WILL
need
to
restart
your
reader
and
readerOutput
again
.

First
,
when
AVAssetReaderOutput
's
copyNextSampleBuffer
returns
NULL
,
check
AVAssetReader.error.code
for
AVErrorOperationInterrupted
.

The
way
we
pull
off
a
gapless
recovery
here
is
when
we
get
to
that
point
,
we
first
calculate
the
exact
time
we
left
off
at
(
easy
to
do
-
-
just
maintain
a
counter
of
the
total
samples
already
output
)
.

Then
,
you
WILL
need
to
restart
your
AVAssetReader
and
AVAssetReaderOutput
flow
.

But
that
's
no
problem
since
your
good
development
practices
would
have
encapsulated
that
in
a
single
function
that
has
a
seek
time
as
an
argument
.

In
that
function
,
use
AVAssetReader.timeRange
to
seek
to
that
time
you
need
to
resume
at
and
presto
!

There
first
thing
I
would
try
is
:

Not
calling
AudioOutputUnitStop
?

Why
do
n't
you
leave
the
graph
running
and
when
the
audio
is
paused
simply
not
call

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2061
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Instead
just
fill
the
buffer
with
0
's
and/or
use
a
render
action
of
kAudioUnitRenderAction_OutputIsSilence
for
the
buffers
.

Starting
and
stopping
the
graph
takes
time
and
leads
to
an
unresponsive
graph
.

I
never
stop
the
graph
while
my
apps
are
running
.

(
Unless
some
serious
interruption
happens
)
This
may
keep
the
asset
reader
around
and
happy
.

But
I
have
a
hunch
that
as
the
AVAssetReader
is
not
directly
connected
to
the
audio
graph
(
you
just
happen
to
request
samples
and
place
them
in
the
buffer
supplied
by
the
render
callback
)
the
problem
does
not
lie
with
the
audio
graph
being
stopped
and
restarted
at
all
.

So
the
next
line
of
attack
I
would
try
is
to
request
samples
from
an
AVAsset
,
put
the
app
into
the
background
and
bring
it
back
to
the
foreground
without
using
an
AUGraph
at
all
.

This
will
determine
if
the
problem
is
related
to
the
AUGraph
or
the
app
entering
a
background
state
.

If
something
happens
that
forces
you
to
tear
down
your
AVAssetReader
you
will
have
to
reconnect
to
the
asset
.

So
as
you
have
to
write
that
code
another
the
option
I
would
look
at
is
the
one
you
do
n't
want
to
do
.

Reconnect
to
the
AVAssetReader
,
seek
to
the
position
you
left
off
at
and
keep
going
.

Before

back

You
can
restore
your
bash
profile
(
or
anything
else
you
need
)
from
the
backup
.

Your
"
bash
profile
"
is
the
first
of
~
/bash_login
,
or
~
/.bash_profile
,
or
~
/.profile
that
exists
,
plus
~
/.bashrc
if
it
exists
,
plus
any
files
that
these

import
.

All
of
these
are
plain

can
be
copied
with

Your

are
not
properly-speaking
anything
to
do
with
bash
,
but
you
might
consider
them
part
of

"
.

You
can
make
a
copy
with
defaults
export
com.apple.Terminal

restore
it
later

The

option
means
that
the

"
end

commands
must
be
run
from
the
same
folder
,
e.g
.
the
current

should
be
the
same
when
running
the
commands
(
if
you

the

commands
the

should
be

)
.

Edit
:

This
particular
problem
seems
to
be
caused
because
the
build
is
executing
older
version
of
MSBuild
.

Please
,
make

viz

You

use
the

-
viz[node]
-
on
it
.

CODE_BLOCK

A_3659
(

this
is
also
an
error
,
since
your

so
you
must
cast
the
result
of
pop()
to
Integer
:

CODE_BLOCK

You
ca
n't
use
array
syntax
(array
[
index
]
)
for
stacks
,
you
have
to
use
push()
,
pop()
,
and
peek()

Stacks
work
on
a
first-in
,
last-out
basis
.

So
,
the
only
element
in
the
stack
that
is
accessible
is
the
top
one
.

When
you
use
pop()
,
you
remove
the
top
item
so
that
the
next
can
be
accessed
.

push()
is
used
to
put
a
value
on
the
top
and
peek()
is
used
to
check
the
top
item
without
popping
it
.

If
I
have
the
following
stack

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3656
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Using
pop()
,
will
return
"
Sam
"
and
remove
it
from
the
stack
,
so
it
will
look
like
this
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3657
(
code
omitted

Pushing
"
Charlie
"
will
make
the
stack
look
this
this
.

CODE_BLOCK

A_3658
(
code

I

have
to

struct
and
array
,
which
other
answers
recommend
,
are
fine
for
the
details
of
the
implementation
,
and
might
be
all
you
need
if
your
needs
are
always
to
sequentially
read
all
of
the
file
or
a
prefix
of
it
.

Other
options
include
buffer
,
mmap
,
even
ctypes
,
depending
on
many
details
you
do
n't
mention
regarding
your
exact
needs
.

Maybe
a
little
specialized
Cython-coded
helper
can
offer
all
the
extra
performance
you
need
,
if
no
suitable
and
accessible
library
(
in
C
,
C++
,
Fortran
,
..
.
)
already
exists
that
can
be
interfaced
for
the
purpose
of
handling
this
humongous
file
as
you
need
to
.

But
clearly
there
are
peculiar
issues
here
-
-
how
can
a
data
file
contain
pointers
,
for
example
,
which
are
intrinsically
a
concept
related
to
addressing
memory
?

Are
they
maybe
"
offsets
"
instead
,
and
,
if
so
,
how
exactly
are
they
based
and
coded
?

Are
your
needs
at
all
more
advanced
than
simply
sequential
reading
(
e.g
.
,
random
access
)
,
and
if
so
,
can
you
do
a
first
"
indexing
"
pass
to
get
all
the
offsets
from
start
of
file
to
start
of
record
into
a
more
usable
,
compact
,
handily-formatted
auxiliary
file
?

(
That
binary
file
of
offsets
would
be
a
natural
for
array
-
-
unless
the
offsets
need
to
be
longer
than
array
supports
on
your
machine
!
)
.

What
is
the
distribution
of
record
lengths
and
compositions
and
number
of
records
to
make
up
the
"
tens
of
gigabytes
"
?

Etc
,
etc
.

You
have
a
very
large
scale
problem
(
and
no
doubt
very
large
scale
hardware
to
support
it
,
since
you
mention
that
you
can
easily
read
all
of
the
file
into
memory
that
means
a
64bit
box
with
many
tens
of
GB
of
RAM
-
-
wow
!

)
,
so
it
's
well
worth
the
detailed
care
to
optimize
the
handling
thereof
-
-
but
we
ca
n't
help
much
with
such
detailed
care
unless
we
know
enough
detail
to
do
so
!

Answer_to_Question_ID

25614976

Question_URL

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25614976/

For
one
,
your
queue
implementation
is
not
thread-safe
at
this
point
.

Your
question
strongly
suggests
that
this
code
will
be
used
in
a
multi-threaded
environment
.

Having
a
non
thread-safe
queue
will
give
you
wrong
results
,
and
weird
things
can
happen
(
like
removeFromQueue()
returning
the
same
thing
to
two
different
threads
,
or
addToQueue()
inserting
two
items
in
the
same
position
)
.

Aside
from
that
,
your
queue
implementation
would
never
work
.

You
are
not
using
front
and
rear
correctly
.

Look
carefully
at
the
insert
function
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3531
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

You
check
if
rear
is
MAX
,
yet
,
you
write
into
queue[front]
and
increment
front
.

What
if
I
just
keep
adding
items
to
the
queue
,
eventually
reaching
the
buffer
's
limit
?

rear
will
always
be
0
,
front
will
grow
indefinitely
,
and
your
function
will
write
beyond
the
limits
of
queue
.

That
's
probably
the
cause
of
your
segmentation
fault
errors
.

I
think
you
wanted
to
check
for
front
instead
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3532
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
code
for
removeFromQueue()
looks
superficially
ok
,
as
long
as
queue
is
a
global
array
(
since
you
're
returning
a
pointer
,
and
ca
n't
return
pointers
to
local
variables
)
.

However
,
the
single
,
most
important
fact
you
have
to
take
out
of
this
answer
,
is
that
your
queue
implementation
will
not
scale
in
the
long-term
.

An
array-based
queue
is
a
terrible
choice
.

What
do
you
do
when
you
run
out
of
space
in
the
array
?

What
if
I
insert
MAX
elements
,
then
remove
2
or
3
,
and
try
to
insert
more
?

Your
code
will
say
the
queue
is
full
,
because
it
only
ever
allows
you
to
insert
MAX
elements
in
total
.

You
could
shift
every
element
in
the
queue
to
the
left
when
an
element
is
removed
,
but
that
's
crazy
,
and
extremely
inefficient
.

Or
you
could
increment
front
modulo
MAX
,
allowing
rear
to
be
ahead
of
front
,
as
long
as
you
know
that
no
more
than
MAX
elements
can
be
inserted
.

That
would
be
better
,
but
it
would
break
the
logic
in
removeFromQueue()
,
since
the
pointers
returned
earlier
will
possibly
point
to
a
different
thread
struct
as
you
manipulate
the
queue
-
total
disaster
.

Definitely
not
what
you
want
.

A
much
,
much
better
approach
would
be
to
implement
this
with
a
linked
list
where
you
keep
a
pointer
to
the
head
and
a
pointer
to
the
tail
.

as

how

I
got
a
problem
when
positioning
three
divs
side
by
side

Those
three

contain
normal
text
but
also
have
a
link
at
the
bottom
.

To
get
this

the

are
inline-block
with
a
width
of
32%
.

Now
the
problem
is
,
that
when
I
change
the
window
size
,
the
height
of
the
items
are
different
.

I
want
the
links
at
the
bottom
of
the
items
to
be
at
the
same
position
,
like
this
:

But
actual
it
looks
like
this
:

I
used
JavaScript
to
set
those
items
to
the
same
height
,
but
how
can
I
get
theese
links
to
the
same
position
?

I
know
this
can
be
done
by
setting
the
item
to
position
:
relative
;
and
the
a
to
position
:
absolute
;
bottom
:
0
;
but
then
text-align

center
;
does
n't
work
anymore
.

I

Since
you
asked
for
a
solution
without
position
:
absolute
;
bottom
:
0
;
I
give
you
the
following
approach
.

What
you
can
do
is
that
you
wrap
up
your
content
containers
into
another
div-container
and
insert
the
link
after
your
content
container
.

You
would
get
a
pseudo
structure
like
that
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4738
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

For
every
three
of
your
content
containers
.

Working
with
your
javascript
resizeFunction
the
links
are
on
the
same
height
all
the
time
.

Note
that
your
div.content-wrapper
is
display:inline-block
;
now
,
but
your
div.content
are
not
.

Flex
can
do
this
very
easily
but
with
some
what
less
browser
support
.

Another
way
is
using
display
:
table
,
which
have
very
good
support
(
down
to
IE8
)
,
at
the
end
you
find
a
sample
using
that
.

One
more
way
,
thinking
in
the
terms
of
"
rows
"
,
is
like
this
,
where
there
is
no
absolute
position
,
no
script
and
keep
your
links
at
the
bottom
,
all
centered
.

Update

As
requested
,
and
to
make
it
more
responsive
,
I
added
a
media
query
.

Run
the
snippet
in
full
page
and
resize
the
browser
to
see
it
in
action
.

To
be
noted
though
,
this
is
still
a
"
without
using
flex
"
solution
.

I
have
a
SOAP
web
service
running
on
windows
which
is
secured
with
NTLM
authentication
.

I
cannot
change
this
.

When
I
open
an
URL
to
the
web
service
I
get
a
password
dialog
and
when
I
authenticate
then
I
can
see
the
WSDL
,
so
I
know
it
is
working
.

Now
I
am
trying
to
configure
Maven
to
generate
Java
classes
from
the
WSDL
.

I
found
the
maven-jaxb2-plugin
for
Maven
and
it
should
be
suitable
for
this
task
.

My
problem
now
is
that
I

I
do
not
know
how
to
give
this
plugin
or
maven
the
necessary
credentials
to
connect
to
the
web
service
.

So
my
question
is
is
it
possible
to
configure
the
above
plugin
such
that
I
can
pass
it
the
NTLM
credentials
?

when

then
the

But
this
is
not

a
solution
because
I
do
n't
want
to
switch
to
windows
each
time
I
need
to

that

Your
code
first
created
a
constant
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5450
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

And
then
you
check
whether
it
is
less
than
1
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5451
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Since
it
is
a
constant
,
it
will
never
change
.

This
means
that
the
if
clause
will
always
be
executed
.

Thus
,
the
else
clause
will
never
be
executed
.

So
first
you
need
to
make
this
constant
variable
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5452
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Then
just
change
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5453
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

to
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5454
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
way
,
numberOFChannelSubscribedToIs
can
be
some
number
other
than
0
.

And
the
else
clause
can
be
executed
.

way

to
assume
that
all

complete
and
just
enumerate

,
col5
.

This

sequence
number
is
then
used
for

For

,
I
further
assume
that

If

inline
all
conditions
/
predicates.
.

.
.
then
you
can
supply
them
just
like
that
to
your
SelectQuery

:

CODE_BLOCK

A_3569
(

I
've

If
you
want
to
perform
dynamic
query
building.
.

.
.
Then
you
can
create
your
predicate
in
various
steps
:

CODE_BLOCK

A_3570
(

Both

I
'm
looking
at
the
documentation
now
and
it
looks
like
you
can
use
the
addConditions
methods
with
an
OR
operator
to
accomplish
your
nested
query
.

There
are
4
different
overloaded
methods
with
addConditions
but
the
last
two
allow
you
to
supply
an
operator
(
in
your
case
OR
)
and
one
of
those
allows
you
to
string
together
multiple
conditions
using
a
supplied
operator
.

So
all
you
need
to
do
is
break
apart
your
nested
statements
into
separate
conditions
and
then
link
them
together
with
your
addConditions
(
[Collection
of
Conditions
]
,
OR
)
statement
.

This

Basically
,
you
only
append

so
you
use

searching

I
am
trying

to
another

I
declare
two
global
string
variables
-

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_850
(

Then
I
have
a
function
for
getting

line
arguments
.

Whenever
a
user
enters
a
filename
in
a
command
line
argument
,
it
should
be
stored
in
rest
and
then
rest
is
appended
to
grid_filename
.

CODE_BLOCK

Now
whenever
I
run
my

valgrind
gives
me
this
error
-

CODE_BLOCK

I
print
out
the
two

and
neither

them
match
the
one
valgrind
is
saying
is
0

What
am
I
missing
here
?

I
believe
this
leads
to
my
second

because
I
pass
grid_filename
to
another

sends
the

over
a

Valgrind
tells

I
'm
running

app

But
if

it
gives
me
an

Pretty

but
do
I
have
to

it
"

?

Is
there
some
sort
of
an
"
automatic

library
that
would
try
to
load
WebRTC
(
2.0
)
TB.min.js
,
and
if
it
fails
fall
back
to
Flash
(
0.9
)
version
?

Also
a
related
question
-
will
all
these
versions
interoperate
?

I.e
.

can
Chromes
(
running

)
talk

IE
(
running

and
talk

To
have
WebRTC
capabilities
on
IE
,
users
could
install
Chrome
Frame
(
for
IE6+
)
.

It
is
a
valid
option
,
but
you
should
know
that
it
is
no
longer
being
actively
supported
by
Google
.

As
far
as
I
know
,
there
is
no
automatic
switching
library
.

However
,
on
your
server
,
you
could
look
at
the
HTTP
requests
and
find
out
the
client
's
browser
.

From
there
,
you
could
dynamically
load
either
the
WebRTC
or
Flash
library
depending
on
the
browser
's
support
for
WebRTC
.

Currently
,
the
OpenTok
WebRTC
library
supports
:

Chrome
23+

Firefox
22+

Unfortunately
,
OpenTok
does
not
interoperate
between
Flash
and
WebRTC
clients
.

WebRTC
clients
can
operate
with
other
WebRTC
clients
(
mobile
,
web
,
etc
.
)
,
just
like
Flash
can
only
operate
with
other
Flash
clients
.

For
example
,
an
iOS
client
would
have
to
use
the
WebRTC
SDK
and
the
Chrome/Firefox
web
app
would
have
to
include
the
WebRTC
Javascript
library
.

I
am
writing
a
script
which
reads
values
from
a
CSV
through
pandas
into
a
DataFrame
.

The
values
,
'
A
'
and
'
B
'
,
are
inputs
into
an
equation
.

This
equation
is
obtained
from
an
XML
output
file
from

external
program
.

The
equation
provides
a
result
for
'
A
'
and
'
B
'
row-by-row
of
the
DataFrame
and
places
those
results
back
into
the
original
DataFrame
.

If
I
make
a
function
definition
,
explicitly
write
the
equation
in
the
definition
,
and
return
that
that
equation
,
things
work
fine
.

e.g
.
,

CODE_BLOCK

Q_3607
(

However
,
what
I
really
want
to
do
is
"
build
"
that
same
equation
from
an
XML
file
rather
than
entering
it
in
explicitly
.

So
,
I
basically
pull
'
terms
'
and
'
coefficients
'
from
the
xml
file
and
result
in
a
string
form
of
the
equation
.

I
then
convert
the
string
to
an
executable
function
using
sympy.sympify()
.

e.g
.
,

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_3608
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
result
is
that
when
I
call
to
execute
this
equation
over
the
dataFrame
the
literal
equation
is
copied
into
the
"
outPut
"
DF
rather
than
the
row
by
row
result
for
each
'
A
'
and
'
B
'
.

I
do
n't
understand
why
Python
sees
these
code
examples
differently
,
nor
how
to
achieve
the
result
I
want
from
the
first
example
.

For
some
reason
the
sympify()
result
is
not
executable
.

The
same
seems
to
occur
when
I
use
eval()
.

according

I

trying

build
a
simple
video
game
for
a
university
course
using
altera
DE0
or
DE2
or
DE1-SoC

,
i
looked
at
the
isa
for
the
nios
II
cpu
there
is
no
atomic
test-and-set
instruction
in
the
ISA
.

how
would
i
build
a
simple
lock
here
,
anything
that
enforces
mutual
exclusion
for
a
tiny
period
will
work
.

we
are
gonna
have
code
that
is
gonna
run
from
main()
and
code
that
will
run
in
the
Interrupt
Service
Routine
,
and
i
want
to
put
locks
on
some
variables
,
is
it
possible
?

It
appears
the
Nios
II
architecture
does
n't
have
atomic
test-and-set
instructions
.

Instead
for
synchronization
of
shared
resources
between
multiple
Nios
II
processors
,
the
architecture
uses
an
"
Hardware
Mutex
Core
"
.

It
works
as
a
shared
peripheral
that
provides
an
atomic
test-and-test
operation
.

You
can
read
more
about
it
in
Altera
's
Creating
Multiprocessor
Nios
II
Systems
Tutorial
.

However
,
you
probably
do
n't
an
atomic
test-and-set
operation
.

You
can
make
any
sequence
of
instructions
atomic
with
respect
to
interrupts
on
a
single
core
system
simply
by
disabling
interrupts
.

Question_URL

The
schemaLocation
does
not
matter
but
your
input
sample
has
the
default
namespace
declaration
xmlns
=
"
http://www.w3schools.com
"
on
the
root
element
which
puts
all
elements
in
that
namespace
.

Your
XSLT
however
uses
paths
like
school/personen/person
which
(
in
XSLT/XPath
1.0
)
select
elements
in
no
namespace
.

Either
move
to
an
XSLT
2.0
processor
where
you
can
then
define
xpath-default-namespace
=
"
http://www.w3schools.com
"
on
your
stylesheet
or
,
if
you
want
to
solve
it
with
XSLT
1.0
,
declare
xmlns:df
=
"
http://www.w3schools.com
"
in
your
stylesheet
and
adapt
your
paths
to
use
that
prefix
as
in
df:school/df:personen/df:person
and
df:name
and
so
on
.

Without
you
posting
the
error
,
it
's
just
guess
work
as
to
what
's
going
wrong
.

But
probably
you
should
add
a
super()
call
inside
the
constructor
.

Another
point
of
interest
is
the
almost
same
name
of
the
class
,
besides
the
capital
.

It
's
common
practice
to
have
your
class
name
in
PascalCase
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5890
(
code
omitted
for

)

After
you
posted
your
error
,
it
is
obvious
what
you
have
to
do
first
.

Before
setting
the
request
headers
,
you
have
to
open
the
request
using
the
open
method
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5891
(

After

I
'm
new
to
programming
and
today
I
'm
here
because
I
need
help
with
a
simple
exercise
that
I
'm
trying
to
solve
.

The
exercise
consists
of
various
small
parts
:

1)
Define
a
struct
called
Point
with
two
x
and
y
coordinates
(
double
)
.

2)
Prompt
the
user
to
enter
7
(
x
,
y
)
pairs
.

3)
As
we
read
those
pairs
we
have
to
store
them
in
a
vector
of
Points
called
original_points
.

So
this
is
my
first
attempt
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_4129
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

If
a
simple
format
error
occurs
,
I
try
to
recover
by
skipping
every
character
until
the
program
reaches
a
'
(
'
.

My
problem
is
that
if
I
try
to
enter
a
wrong
input
format
such
as
:
9
,
99
)
the
code
will
push_back()
both
the
first
correct
reading
after
the
error
and
also
the
first
one
before
the
error
occurred
.

So
for
example
if
I
try
to
input
such
data
:

(
1
,
2)

9
,
99
)

(
5
,
6
)

I
will
have
three
elements
in
my
vector
:
(
1
,
2)
,
(
1
,
2)
again
,
and
(
5
,
6
)
.

It
seems
like
when
I
get
into
the
loop
after
every
condition
check
the
value
of
P
remains
the
same
instead
of
creating
a
new
Point
object
for
every
iteration
.

Could
you
help
me
please
with
this
problem
?

Why
is
this
error
occurring
?

Thank
you

There
are
multiple
things
here
that
are
not
ok
.

First
of
all
,
you
do
n't
initialize
the
Point
,
so
it
has
some
random
data
.

The
random
data
is
not
so
random
,
because
in
the
loop
the
memory
allocation
is
always
the
same
,
so
the
variable
will
have
the
data
of
the
last
loop
.

In
operator>>(...)
here
you
have
a
"
return
is
"
,
if
the
first
char
is
not
a
'
(
'

so
you
jump
out
of
there
without
setting
p.x
and
p.y
.

The
function
skip_to_character(...)
is
another
thing
that
is
n't
ok
,
besides
the
fact
that
it
is
hard
to
read
and
a
really
bad
way
to
use
a
for
loop
,
there
wo
n't
be
a
'
C
'
when
you
enter
"
9
,
99
)
"
so
i
guess
here
you
get
the
"
No
input
"
output
.

And
now
to
the
for
loop
in
you
main
:

Here
is
what
happens
:

you
create
a
Point
p
without
initializing
it

your
read
garbage
out
of
the
stream
and
p
wo
n't
be
set

you
skip
garbage

you
push
your
uninitialized
Point
p
into
the
vector

If
you
do
n't
believe
me
that
there
is
no
data
in
p
.

Try
to
initialize
it
with
0
or
something
else
and
check
the
output

So
,
I
have
an
image
like
this
:
http://imgur.com/qBGvP

It
always
looks
like
that
,
although
the
numbers
might
differ
.

It
's
a
gif
,
the
background
is
transparent
,
and
the
numbers
white
.

I
need
some
way
to
parse
it
to
numbers
to
be
used
in
a
script
.

Any
ideas
how
I
can
solve
this
?

If
the
font
is
monospace
and
the
position
of
the
number
in
the
image
is
constant
,
it
should
be
trivial
to
break
down
the
image
into
individual
digits
.

Then
,
output
each
image
to
some
format
(
PNG
is
probably
best
)
and
compare
the
files
.

This
works
best
if
you
have
the
same
script
save
known
digits
and
then
compare
them
to
the
actual
case
data
.

If
this
is
not
possible
,
you
will
have
to
do
a
pixel-for-pixel
comparison
,
which
is
n't
that
big
of
a
problem
on
such
small
images
.

Essentially
you
're
making
an
extremely
primitive
OCR
by
having
a
program
that
's
along
the
lines
of
"
this
is
what
the
digits
look
like
,
so
what
number
is
this
?

I
have
a
date
input
box
with
a
pop-up
calendar
date
selector
.

When
I
click
on
the
date
box
the
popup

appears
.

Then
I
can
either

Select
a
date
.

The
date
appears
in
the
date
box
and
the
calendar
appears

Click
outside
the
calendar
.

The
calendar
disappears
.

This
is
via
a
mouseup
event
that
checks
what
was
clicked
.

Type
a
date
in
the
date
box
.

What
I
want
:
When
I
type
a
date
in
the
date
box
and
tab
away
,
then
I
want
the
calendar
to
disappear
.

I
have
tried
this
by
adding
an
onBlur
event
to
the
date
box
.

This
event
made
the
calendar
go
away
.

However
,
this
means
that
the
calendar
disappears
when
I
click
inside
the
calendar
,
which
I
do
n't
want
.

So
I
need
some
kind
of
date
box
onBlur
event
that
checks
whether
the
calendar
was
clicked/has
focus
.

Or
something
else
altogether
.

I
tried
to
check
whether
the
calendar
has
focus
.

Using
jquery
I
did
:

CODE_BLOCK

This
did
nothing
useful
.

Normally
I
'd
use
an
onCLick
event
to
see
what
was
clicked
,
but
then
I
'd
need
an
OnClick
and
an
OnBlur
event
and
the
OnBlur
event
would
need
the
result
of
the
onClick
event
.

However
,
I
do
n't
seem
to
be
able
to
control
what
gets
called
first
.

I
tried
using
the
Chrome
and
IE
JS
debuggers
to
see
what
is
going
on
,
but
adding
breakpoints
seem
to
change
what
functions
are
called
,
which
makes
no
sense
.

Adding
a
breakpoint
in
the
onBlur
event
:
it
stops
there
.

Adding
a
breakpoint
in
the
mouseUp
event
:
it
stops
there
.

Adding
a
breakpoint
in
both
events
:
it
only
stops
in
the
onBlur

even
though
I
do
continue
.

I

new
year
,
I
wo
n't
be
able
to
display
birthdays
in
the
new
year
since
I
'm
setting
the
year
of
the
birthday
to
the
current
year
and
difference.day
will
be
way
less
than
0
for
the
birthdays
in
the
new
year
.

How
do
I
go
about
fixing
that
?

As
you
can
see
from
the
above
snippet
I
'm
doing
a
lot
of
dancing
:
first
I
get
today
's
date
and
time
with
[
NSDate
date
]
,
then
I
rip
it
to
its
components
and
assemble
it
back
to
an
NSDate
with
a
time
at
noon
rather
than
the
current
time
.

The
reason
I
'm
doing
this
is
that
if
[
NSDate
date
]
returns
a
date
whose
time
is
say
23:00:00
,
and
if
the
birthday
time
is
00:00:00
(
1
hour
later
,
meaning
the
birthday
is
tomorrow
)
,
then
difference.day
equals
0
instead
of
the
desired
1
.

Is
what
I
did
in
the
above
snippet
the
proper
way
of
doing
this
?

I
think
I
might
be
doing
too
much
work
for
something
seemingly
so
simple
,
how
would
you
fix
this
arrangement
so
that
I
do
n't
have
to
slice
today
and
birthday
into
components
and
put
them
back
into
an
NSDate
?

Yes
this
is
possible
.

You
need
to
run
a
webserver
or
loadbalancer
listening
to
port
443
and
forwarding
requests
appropriately
.

In
Apache
for
example
this
would
be
handled
as
follows
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6665
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Now
while
Apache
does
support
HTTP/2
in
both
the
front
end
client
connections
and
the
back
end
ProxyPass
requests
(
with
mod_proxy_http
2)
,
some
other
webservers/loadbalancers
do
n't
(
e.g
.
Nginx
)
.

To
be
honest
most
of
the
benefits
for
HTTP/2
are
in
the
client
to
edge
.

So
if
you
prefer
to
use
Nginx
for
example
,
you
could
just
have
Nginx
support
HTTP/2
,
and
the
connection
from
Nginx
to
your
back
end
apps
be
plain
old
HTTP/1.1
.

At
least
until
HTTP/2
becomes
more
regularly
supported
.

I
am
a
new
user
of
Json.net
and
I
am
stuck
because
of
an
error
message
.

I
want
to
read
a
json
file
thanks
to
JsonTextReader
using
json.net

My
json
file
is
a
list
of
my
class
Person
with
some
attributes
looks
like
that
:

http://pastebin.com/DbSDVt2K

When
reading
with
the
StreamReader
(
or
TextReader
)
I
have
no
problem
.

What
i
want
is
to
have
the
same
result
with
an
output
of
type
JsonTextReader
.

Here
is
my
piece
of
code
to
help
you
understand
:

http://pastebin.com/iwF3xuUp

My
error
is
with
:
myString
=
reader.ReadAsString()
;

"
Additional
information
:
Error

Unexpected

.

Path

"

I
have
been
looking
for
hours
to
have
more
info
but
I
found
nothing
that
could
help
me
.

If
any
of
you
can
help
me
understand
this
error
and
find
a
solution
.

You
have
just
to
remove
this
line
from
your
code
:
string
myString
=
reader.ReadAsString()
;
The
Json
Serializer
tries
to
read
a
string
there
,
but
recognizes
that
it
is
an
Array
which
you
're
trying
to
read
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4524
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

and
if
you
want
to
have
it
directly
to
your
correct
type
you
can
also
use
the
generic
Deserialze
instead
of
Deserialize
.

than
you
can
specifiy
the
deserialization
as
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4525
(

Edit
for
the
comment
:

If
you
want
to
reuse
a
JsonReader
you
can
create
a
reader
from
a
JObject
:

If

should
n't
the

have
a

attached

So
what

the

I

your

in
either
in
the
wrong
worksheet
,
or
the
dropdown
is
in
a
different
sheet
than
where
your

Try

If

There
's
nothing
incorrect
about
the
URL
you
're
using
,
so
if
you
're
getting
a
401
it
is
because
you
are
using
an
invalid
client
id
.

Please
double
check
that
the
client
id
is
the
same
as
the
one
you
are
using
when
initializing
the
JavaScript
SDK
.

For
example
,
the
following
works
just
fine
using
a

apps
:

curl

https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks?q=track&client_id=aeb03ac55f278fc7e579c744144b1d5d

The
order

the
parameters

I
have
a
model
that
needs
to
be
saved
in
to
a
MongoDB
collection
.

To
get
the
collection
name
I
have
two
options
before
me
.

1)
Attribute

I
decorate
the
class
with
a
custom
attribute
and
use
reflection
to
access
the
value
inside
it
.

I
can
then
cache
this
with
the
type
to
avoid
future
lookups
.

2)
Static
Property

property
in

class
that
contains
the
collection
name
.

I
find
that
I
am
inclined
to
go
with
the
former
as
it
looks
and
feels
cleaner
but
some
of
the
senior
devs
here
are
turning
their
nose
up
at
the
use
of
reflection
.

Is
there
a
case
to
be
made
for
the
first
option
or
is
it
just
better
to
go
with
option
2
?

This
is
a
clear
case
of
metadata
vs
.
data
:

Option
1
:
Attributes
are
supposed
to
hold
metadata
about
the
entities
they
are
attached
to
.

Option
2
:
member
fields
and
properties
,
regardless
if
instance
or
static
,
are
supposed
to
hold
data
that
make
up
the
integral
value
of
the
class
.

Hence
,
option
1
,
attributes
,
is
the
right
approach
to
represent
metadata
.

Usage
of
reflection
is
a
mere
technicality
and
can
be
encapsulated
into
a
separate
class
,
e.g
.

an
AttributeManager
,
that
would
ease
access
to
metadata
and
cache
them
appropriately
to
avoid
performance
overhead
(
should
that
be
an
issue
in
a
particular
case
)
.

Question_ID

I
'm
at
a
client
site
where
they
have
an
application
which
began
in
SharePoint
and
is
slowly
migrating
away
to
a
very
custom
ASP.NET
application
.

Some
of
their
data
elements
are
still
hosted
within
SharePoint
lists
,
two
of
which
currently
in
question
are
some
"
Notes
"
and
"
Tasks
"
(
fairly
simple
data
elements
in
their
SharePoint
setup
,
nothing
special
about
them
)
.

One
of
the
things
I
need
to
be
able
to
do
from
within
ASP.NET
is
to
automatically
create
some
new
items
for
these
lists
and
add
them
from
code
.

So
far
it
's
pretty
easy
.

I
found
the
existing
web
part
which
handled
the
editing
for
those
items
,
attached
the
debugger
to
it
,
tracked
how
it
got
its
values
and
what
it
added
to
the
list
,
etc
.

However
,
one
of
the
fields
being
added
to
the
list
item
is
n't
quite
as
obvious
.

In
the
existing
web
part
UI
,
the
field
looks
like
this
:

Essentially
,
it
's
a
field
for
entering
a
user
from
the
current
Windows
domain
.

The
book
icon
opens
a
pop-up
which
allows
the
user
to
search
for
a
name
,
etc
.

In
my
current
testing
,
I
'm
running
as
local
Administrator
on
a
development
machine
.

So
I
just
look
for
"
admin
"
in
the
pop-up
and
it
populates
the
field
with
"
[
machine
name
]
\Administrator
"
as
expected
.

Then
,
in
debugging
,
the
value
that
gets
pulled
from
the
field
and
entered
into
the
SharePoint
list
item
is
"
1
"
as
opposed
to
a
name
or
anything
like
that
.

I
assume
that
"
1
"
is
an
identifier
for
the
local
admin
account
.

Makes
sense
,
after
all
.

But
my
question
is
,
how
can
I
get
that
identifier
for
the
current
logged-in
user
in
code
?

I
've
found
code
to
get
the
current
user
's
name
,
but
not
any
kind
of
numeric
(
even
though
it
's
a
string
)
ID
.

Additionally
,
this
would
n't
just
be
happening
inside
of
an
ASP.NET
application
context
.

There
's
also
a
WPF
client
application
for
laptops
which
would
be
generating
these
list
items
and
synchronizing
them
back
to
the
server
when
connected
.

I
'm
currently
operating
on
the
assumption
that
the
client
user
would
be
logged
in
with
a
proper
domain
account
known
to
the
server
.

I
imagine
this
is
pretty
easy
,
I
just
have
n't
stumbled
across
what
I
need
quite
yet
.

to

perhaps
-

other
than

going

where

Your
code
is
all
good
.

Just
one
mistake
,
you
are
using
%d
to
concatenate
the
decimals
after
your
id
.

But
that
is
not
necessary
since
%d
is
automatically
added
to
the
supplied
id
.

Please
find
codex
link
at
the
end
of
this
answer
.

So
,
I
removed
the
%d
from
the
id
section
of
your
code
and
now
it
works
.

Solution
:

CODE_BLOCK

A_5723
(

and

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5724
(

You
do
not
need
to
add
%d
to
id
of
register_sidebars
.

Please
read
the
codex
,

it
says
:

"
%d
"
is
added

I
'm
using
.NET
entity
framework
4.1
with
code-first
approach
to
effectively
solve
the
following
problem
,
here
simplified
.

There
's
a
database
table
with
tens
of
thousands
of
entries
.

Several
users
of
my
program
need
to
be
able
to

View
the
(
entire
)
table
in
a
GridRow
,
which
implied
that
the
entire
Table
has
to
be
downloaded
.

Modify
values
of
any
random
row
,
changes
are
frequent
but
need
not
be
persisted
immediately
.

It
's
expected
that
different
users
will
modify
different
rows
,
but
this
is
not
always
true
.

Some
loss
of
changes
is
permitted
,
as
users
will
most
likely
update
same
rows
to
same
values
.

On
occasion
add
new
rows
.

Sounds
simple
enough
.

My
initial
approach
was
to
use
a
long-running
DbContext
instance
.

This
one
DbContext
was
supposed
to
track
changes
to
the
entities
,
so
that
when
SaveChanges()
is
called
,
most
of
the
legwork
is
done
automatically
.

However
many
have
pointed
out
that
this
is
not
an
optimal
solution
in
the
long
run
,
notably
here
.

I
'm
still
not
sure
if
I
understand
the
reasons
,
and
I
do
n't
see
what
a
unit-of-work
is
in
my
scenario
either
.

The
user
chooses
herself
when
to
persist
changes
,
and
let
's
say
that
client
always
wins
for
simplicity
.

It
's
also
important
to
note
that
objects
that
have
not
been
touched
do
n't
overwrite
any
data
in
the
database
.

Another
approach
would
be
to
track
changes
manually
or
use
objects
that
track
changes
for
me
,
however
I
'm
not
too
familiar
with
such
techniques
,
and
I
would
welcome
a
nudge
in
the
right
direction
.

What
's
the
correct
way
to
solve
this
problem
?

I
understand
that
this
question
is
a
bit
wishy-washy
,
but
think
of
it
as
more
fundamental
.

I
lack
fundamental
understanding
about
how
to
solve
this
class
of
problems
.

It
seems
to
me
that
long
living
DbContext
is
the
right
way
,
but
knowledgeable
people
tell
me
otherwise
,
which
leads
me
to
confusion
and
imprecise
questions
.

EDIT1

Another
point
of
confusion
is
the
existance
of
Local
property
on
the
DbSet
<>
object
.

It
invites
me
to
use
a
long
running
context
,
as
another
user
has
posted
here
.

Answer_to_Question_ID

Sounds
to
me
like
your
users
could
have
a
copy
(
cached
)
of
the
data
for
an
indefinate
period
of
time
.

The
longer
the
users
are
using
cached
data
the
greater
the
odds
that
they
could
become
disconnected
from
the
database
connection
in
DbContext
.

My
guess
is
EF
does
n't
handle
this
well
and
you
probably
want
to
deal
with
that
.

(
e.g
.
occaisionally
connected
architecture
)
.

I
would
expect
implementing
that
may
solve
many
of
your
issues
.

Problem
with
long
running
context
is
that
it
does
n't
refresh
data
-
I
more
discussed
problems
here
.

So
if
your
user
opens
the
list
and
modify
data
half
an
hour
she
does
n't
know
about
changes
.

But
in
case
of
WPF
if
your
business
action
is
:

Open
the
list

Do
as
many
actions
as
you
want

Trigger
saving
changes

Then
this
whole
is
unit
of
work
and
you
can
use
single
context
instance
for
that
.

If
you
have
scenario
where
last
edit
wins
you
should
not
have
problems
with
this
until
somebody
else
deletes
record
which
current
user
edits
.

Additionally
after
saving
or
cancelling
changes
you
should
dispose
current
context
and
load
data
again
-
this
will
ensure
that
you
really
have
fresh
data
for
next
unit
of
work
.

Context
offers
some
features
to
refresh
data
but
it
only
refreshes
data
previously
loaded
(
without
relations
)
so
for
example
new
unsaved
records
will
be
still
included
.

Perhaps
you
can
also
read
about
MS
Sync
framework
and
local
data
cache
.

Thanks

In
the
end
I
took
another
approach
;
instead
of
trying
to
stop
the
user
from
dragging
ANY
of
the
child
control
outside
of
the
boundary
of
the
container
I
have
only
stopped
them
from
dragging
the
pointer
outside
the
boundary
,
e.g
.
in
the
mousemove
eventhandler
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_1635
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
problem
with
this
was
that
the
parts
of
the
child
control
were
visible
outside
of
the
container
.

What
I
did
was
set
the
Clip
property
of
the
parent
control
so
that
the
parts
of
the
child
outside
of
the
boundary
are
hidden
.

e.g
.
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_1636
(
code
omitted
for

)

This
seems
to
work
quite
nicely
!

Answer_to_Question_ID

Question_URL

This
is
no
way
other
than
checking
each
corner
of
the
control
.

However
,
you
can
take
some
shortcuts
as
you
know
that
Dialog
and
what
you
are
dragging
it
over
wo
n't
change
shape
or
size
during
the
drag
and
that
it
's
impossible
for
the
left
hand
edge
of
Dialog
to
be
to
the
right
of
the
right
hand
edge
of
Grid
without
the
right
hand
edge
of
Dialog
also
being
to
the
right
of
Grid
.

This
only
applies
if
Dialog
is
not
rotated
.

So
,
you
'll
need
something
like
the
following
pseudo

The

to

This
pops

a

there

a

Next

I
am
performing
a
custom
traversal
in
Neo4J
,
using
my
own
evaluator
.

In
the
traversal
are
two
nodes
,
connected
by
two
different
relationships
.

What
I
'm
seeing
is
that
only
one
of
the
two
relationships
will
be
walked
during
the
traversal
.

However
,
my
custom
evaluation
changes
its
behavior
based
on
whether
both
relationships
are
present
.

It
seems
like
during
a
traversal
,
Neo4J
maintains
a
set
of
visited
nodes
,
and
if
a
candidate
path
ends
at
a
node
that
has
already
been
visited
,
then
that
path
is
never
sent
to
my
evaluator
.

Is
there
a
way
around
this
?

How
can
I
have
a
custom
evaluator
examine
every
possible
path
to
the
nodes
?

Here
's
a
quick
example
:

Say
that
the
graph
looks
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_3164
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
traversal
begins
at
A
.

A
has
two
different
relationships
tying
it
to
B
(
of
two
different
types
)
.

All
of
the
remaining
nodes
are
connected
by
only
1
relationship
.

The
goal
of
the
evaluator
is
to
return
A-D
,
A-B
,
and
B-C
,
but
not
D-E
.

The
determination
that
B-C
is
valid
comes
from
the
fact
that
there
are
two
relationships
between
A
and
B
.

How
can
this
be
solved
?

You
may
need
to
think
your
use
case
through
a
bit
more
carefully
.

One
suggestion
is
that
when
you
use
the
traversal
framework
in
java
,
basically
you
can
build
a
TraversalDescription
and
then
iterate
through
what
comes
back
from
it
by
relationships
,
rather
than
by
Paths
or
by
Nodes
.

If
your
primary
complaint
is
that
each
node
is
visited
only
once
,
you
can
change
the
TraversalDescription
to
specify
RELATIONSHIP_GLOBAL
guaranteeing
that
all
relationships
will
be
followed
,
whether
or
not
that
causes
you
to
hit
a
node
more
than
once
.

More
broadly
,
traversers
do
n't
tend
to
go
over
the
same
material
more
than
once
because
if
they
did
,
you
'd
need
to
be
ultra
careful
about
specifying
a
termination
condition
.

If
hitting
certain
nodes
or
relationships
more
than
once
is
OK
,
when
do
you
know
that
you
're
done
?

I
am
brand
new
to
PyQt
so
bear
with
me
here
..
.

I
create
a
widget
with
Qt
Designer
,
then
compile
it
and
save
it
as
.py
.

I
edit
the
.py
file
to
add
some
additional
functionality
.

But
then
say
I
need
to
go
back
to
Qt
Designer
and
update
the
layout
of
the
GUI
.

Is
there
a
way
to
compile
that
and
then
update
the
original
.py
file
with
the
changes
rather
than
having
to
manually
copy/paste
my
custom
code
?

Personally
I
hate
compiling
it
.

But
like
ekhumoro
said
,
you
can
import
the
class
.

I
still
dislike
this
though
.

pyuic
sometimes
imports
nasty
example_rc
things
,
which
lowers
productivity
levels
again
.

If
you
absolutely
must
transform
.ui
to
.py
,
create
a
.bat
file
to
do
it
for
you
.

Code
for
that
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3605
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Or
whatever
you
have
for
your
OS
.

Personally
I
like
to
use
ui
=
uic.loadUi('example.ui')
and
then
ui.setupUi()
.

It
allows
you
to
be
much
much
more
efficient
!

If
you
look
at
the
comments
at
the
top
of
the
generated
file
,
you
will
see
this
line
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3585
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
makes
it
quite
clear
that
the
file
is
not
meant
to
be
edited
.

But
this
is
not
a
problem
,
because
it
is
just
an
ordinary
python
module
,
and
so
it
's
easy
enough
to
import
it
into
your
main
application
and
access
it
from
there
.

All
you
need
to
do
is
create
a
subclass
of
the
top-level
object
from
Qt
Designer
(
which
will
be
a
QMainWindow
,
QDialog
or
QWidget
)
,
and
then
use
the
setupUi
method
provided
by
the
generated
module
to
add
all
of
the
widgets
to
an
instance
of
that
subclass
.

So
if
the
top-level
object
from
Qt
Designer
was
named
"
MainWindow
"
,
pyuic
will
create
a
corresponding
Ui_MainWindow
class
that
can
be
imported
into
a
main.py
script
and
used
something
like
this
:

Take
the

I
know
it

O(n^2)
fairly
easy
by
examining
it
.

But
as
far
as
proving
it
's
O(n^2)
,
how
would
I
go
about
doing
that
?

I
could
add
up
all

but
n

I

Could

It
's
O(n^2)
because
you
've
got
a
multiplication
,
not
a
sum
.

Take
by
example
,
an
array
sorted
in
inverse
order
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2513
(
code
omitted
for

In
these
cases
every
iteration
of
the
inner
loop
will
scan
and
shift
the
entire
sorted
subsection
of
the
array
before
inserting
the
next
element
.

This
gives
insertion
sort
a
quadratic
running
time
(
i.e
.
,
O(n2))
.

The
best
way
to
understand
the
complexity
is
trying
to
find
the
worst
case
example
and
following
the
algorithm
's
steps
.

Answer_to_Question_ID

Question_URL

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18972385/

You
prove
big
O
complexity
by
considering
how
many
operations
are
performed
in
the
worst
case
.

You
've
done
the
counting
part
and
entered
the
results
in
the
right
hand
column
of
your
image
,
so
what
remains
to
be
proven
is
that
the
dominant
term
is
O(n^2)
.

Apart
from
the
terms
that
involve
the
sum
,
your
program
consists
of
instructions
that
get
executed
n-1
times
so
these
are
all
O(n)
terms
.

Now
for
the
terms
with
the
sum
.

In
the
worst
case
a
t_j
can
be
j
because
you
may
end
up
decrementing
i
which
you
set
to
j
all
the
way
down
to
0
.

So
in
this
worst
case
we
have
t_j
=
j
and
then
you
have
a
term
with
a
sum
from
2
to
n
of
j
which
is
O(n^2)
.

This
is
due
to
following
the
mathematical
identity
:

This
can
be
proven
by
summing
two
of
these
series
together
,
paying
attention
so
that
you
add
two
terms
that
sum
to
n+1
together
,
and
then
dividing
the
sum
by
two
.

Have
a
look
at
the
proof
in
wolfram
.

Finally
,
since
O
(
(
n^2
+
n
)
/2
)
=
O(n^2)
you
get
that
the
terms
that
include
the
sum
dominate
the
runtime
and
that
is
why
the
algorithm
is
O(n^2)

Well
I
am
not
sure
if
I
understand
your
question
.

If
you
want
to
send
the
audio
stream
directly
to
the
server
while
recording
I
guess
you
could
access
your
ByteArrayOutputStream
(
dataOut
)
in
a
separate
thread
,
get
the
bytes
from
the
stream
,
wrap
them
in
RTP
packages
and
send
them
to
the
streaming
server
.

This
separate
thread
would
be
running
together
with
the
recording
process
.

In
this
way
you
do
n't
need
to
save
the
audio
stream
in
any
file
.

Have
you
tried
this
approach
?

Which

are
you
using

Javascript

Ajax
talking
to
a
PHP
backend
(
transactions
via
JSON
)
.

If
I
'm
dealing
with
the
presentation
of
large
datasets
I
'll
always
page
the
information
server-side
and
pipeline
it
(
load
data
ahead
of
and
behind
the
current
view
to
reduce
transactions
)
,
and
usually
present
in
via
jQuery
DataTables
.

Grids
are
always
your
friend
with
large
amounts
of
data
.

Again
,
personal
preference
,
but
I
make
heavy
use
of
jQuery
UI
for
layout
and
presentation
,
and
I
do
write
custom
Javascript
for
the
"
nifty

one-off
type
things
that
come
up
.

Again
,
any
server
language
you
have
access
to
and
are
comfortable
with
will
suffice
,
as
Javascript
is
language
agnostic
.

Javascript
can
get
out
of
hand
in
a
hurry
.

I
'd
recommend
that
unless
you
have
a
ton
of
time
on
your
hands
that
you
focus
on
clean
presentation
via
something
baseline
like
HTML
with
judicious
use
of
Javascript
and
CSS
for
progressive
enhancement
.

Think
about
the
user
before
you
go
crazy
with
motion
,
dynamic
elements
,
etc
.

Do
n't
forget
the
old
adage
,
"
80%
of
the
people
only
use
20%
of
the
functionality
"
Nail
that
20%
cleanly
before
going
to
town
on
flashy
javascript
fluff
.

Question_URL

Ruby
is
an
object-oriented
language
.

In
an
object-oriented
language
,
you
send
messages
to
objects
and
those
objects
then
respond
to
those
messages
however
they
see
fit
.

This
means
that
the
receiver
of
the
message
,
and
only
the
receiver(!)

is
in
total
control
of
what
a
message
means
.

With
some
operators
,
however
,
there
are
certain
expectations
of
symmetry
:
for
example
,
a
==
b
is
expected
to
be
the
same
as
b
==
a
.

But
in
an
OO
language
that
is
impossible
!

Either
a
or
b
must
be
the
receiver
of
the
message
,
so
in
one
case
a
gets
to
decide
whether
a
and
b
are
equal
and
in
the
other
case
b
gets
to
decide
.

They
might
decide
differently
,
and
then
the
expectation
of
symmetry
would
be
broken
.

So
,
in
some
classes
equality
is
actually
implemented
something
like
this
:

OP_BLOCK
:
(
output
omitted
for
annotation
)

Here
's
an
example
:
if
you
write
your
own
Numeric
class
(
say
,
a
Quaternion
class
)
,
then
the
system
builtin
Fixnum
class
does
n't
know
anything
about
Quaternions
.
So
,
when
you
ask
the
Fixnum
0
whether
it
is
equal
to
the
Quaternion
(
0
,
0
,
0
,
0
)
,
it
will
responds
false
,
even
though
that
's
wrong
.

So
,
instead
the
Fixnum
will
first
check
:
do
I
know
how
to
compare
myself
to
a
Quaternion
?

No
,
I
do
n't
,
but
maybe
a
Quaternion
knows
how
to
compare
itself
to
a
Fixnum
!

After
all
,
the
Quaternion
class
did
n't
exist
when
the
Fixnum
class
was
written
,
so
the
Fixnum
class
cannot
know
about
Quaternions
.
But
when
the
Quaternion
class
was
written
,
maybe
the
author
was
so
thoughtful
to
make
it
possible
to
compare
Quaternions
with
Fixnums
.

That
's
why
Fixnum#
==
reverses
the
arguments
and
tries
again
.

With
String
,
it
's
the
same
but
somewhat
more
complicated
.

In
Ruby
,
classes
are
n't
types
and
subtyping
and
subclassing
are
different
.

Ruby
itself
does
n't
have
a
concept
of
type
at
all
!

The
type
of
an
object
is
its
protocol
,
i.e
.
the
messages
it
understands
and
how
it
responds
to
them
.

But
that
concept
is
not
recorded
in
Ruby
(
unlike
Objective-C
,
for
example
,
which
does
have
an
explicit
notion
of
protocol
)
.

There
,
however
,
some
cases
,
where
you
want
to
break
OO
encapsulation
,
and
know
the
specific
type
and
even
more
:
the
specific
representation
of
the
type
.

(
Note
:
this
violates
OO
,
but
it
is
sometimes
necessary
for
performance
.
)

In
cases
,
where
Ruby
needs
an
object
to
be
of
a
specific
class
instead
of
just
responding
to
a
specific
protocol
,
you
would
lose
a
lot
of
flexibility
.

You
have
to
use
,
say
,
a
String
,
even
though
you
would
much
rather
use
a
Rope
instead
.

In
order
to
give
you
back
some
flexibility
,
Ruby
allows
you
to
pass
in
something
which
is
not
exactly
a
String
but
which
is
equivalent
to
one
and
can
be
converted
to
one
with
a
to_str
method
.

So
,
unlike
other
languages
,
where
A
IS-A
String
is
represented
by
A
being
a
subclass
of
String
,
in
Ruby
,
the
relationship
A
IS-A
String
is
represented
by
A
having
a
to_str
method
.

That
's
what
you
are
seeing
above
.

If
the
argument
to
String#
==
is
n't
a
String
,
then
String#
==
does
n't
know
what
to
do
with
it
.

But
if
it
is
"
string-like
"
,
i.e
.
it
implements
to_str
,
then
maybe
it
does
know
how
to
compare
itself
to
a
String
?

Note
that
equality
is
very
hard
to
get
right
.

People
cannot
even
agree
on
what
it
means
in
a
purely
functional
language
,
and
that
's
the
easy
case
!

In
Ruby
,
there
are
two
additional
complications
:
mutable
state
and
OO
.

Mutable
state
means
that
two
objects
that
were
equal
a
moment
ago
may
not
be
equal
anymore
a
couple
of
moments
later
.

Or
should
they
be
?

Or
should
n't
they
be
?

And
OO
means
that
equality
cannot
be
symmetric
.

That
's
why
the
implementations
of
==
for
various
core
and
stdlib
classes
are
constantly
improved
.

That
's
also
why
you
may
see
weird
behavior
now
and
again
.

Sometimes
it
may
just
be
an
artifact
of
trying
to
get
equality
right
,
and
sometimes
it
might
just
simply
be
a
bug
.

By
the
way
:
for
the
arithmetic
operators
,
subclasses
of
Numeric
actually
have
a
more
formal
double-dispatch
protocol
using
the
coerce
method
.

If
a
Numeric
object
does
n't
know
what
to
do
with
another
Numeric
,
it
will
ask
that
other
object
to
coerce
the
two
objects
to
a
type
that
does
know
that
.

For
example
,
if
you
try
to
add
a
Quaternion
to
a
Fixnum
,
the
Fixnum
wo
n't
know
what
to
do
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2222
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
+
method
of
Fixnum
will
then
call
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2223
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

IOW
:
it
will
call
Quaternion
#coerce
with
the
equivalent
of

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2224
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

to
which
Quaternion
will
respond
with
an
Array
of
[
Quaternion.new(2,0,0,0)
,
Quaternion.new(1,0,0,0)
]

Then
,
Fixnum#+
will
try
again
by
simply
calling

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2225
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Which
will
now
work
because
a
is
a
Quaternion
also
and
knows
how
to
add
two
Quaternions
.

A
very
common
implementation
of
coerce
is
simply
to
swap
the
arguments
,
i.e
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2226
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

That
's
equivalent
to
the
behavior
you
are
seeing
with
Fixnum#
==
.

Again
:
this
kind
of
dispatch
is
hard
to
get
right
,
and
there
are
improvements
being
made
to
the
coerce
protocol
.

Ruby
has
four
levels
of
object
equivalence
:

#equal
?
–
same
object

#eql
?
–
highest
level
of
equivalence
below
same

#
==
–
"

#
==

#

–
loose

"

Mindful

equips
each

with
all
of
these
methods
except
#equal
?
,
which
should
never
be
overriden
.

Going
back
to
the
subject
of
your
question
,
many
built-in
Ruby
objects
have
their
share
of
idiosyncrasies
in
the
implementation
of
these

.

Ruby
core
team
constantly
works

improve
them
,
so
you
should
make
your
way
from
1.8

,
which
fixes
a
number
of
1.8
problems
.

One
more
thing
to
mention
with
#
==
method
,
is
that
for
the
classes
that
represent
elements
of
ordered
sets
,
you
do
not
implement
#
==
directly
,
but
instead
you
provide
#<=>
three-way
comparison
method,
and
include
Comparable
module,
which
gives
you
for
free
methods
such
as
#==,
#<,
#>
,
#sort
,
etc
.

Yet
one
more
thing
to
mention
with
all
of
these
operators
and
operator-like
methods
,
be
mindful
of
the
existence
of
#coerce

,
which
is

An
alternative
to
Kametrixom
's
answer
is
to
make
both

conform
to
a
common
protocol
.

Both
automatically
conform
to
RawRepresentable
,
because
of
the
raw
value
of
String
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4625
(

However
,
you
cannot
use
this
as
the
type
stored
in
the

since
RawRepresentable
is
a

Instead
you
could
do

Just
think
about
it
logically
:
You
want
to
store
multiple
enums
in
an
array
,
so
it
can
be
either
this
or
that
enum
,
which
is
just
what
an

is
!

You
can
declare
an
new
enum
that
has
associated
values
of
all
the
accepted
other
enums
like
so
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4616
(

Then
you
can
create
an
array
like
this
:

This
question
is
related
to
another
question
I
asked

Basically
,
I
have
2
horizontally
aligned
divs
.

Both
sit
inside
a
div
called
"
.Parent
"
,
so
the
structure
is
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_162
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
problem
is
that
the
Parent
div
exists
inside
a
another
div
called
#main
.

#main
has
a
white
background
that
frames
all
of
my
content
.

Before
I
added
the
floats
to
the
divs
inside
.Parent
,
everything
was
fine
because
the
containing
Div
pushed
the
white
background
down
to
the
right
size
.

But
now
that
the
divs
are
floating
,
they
do
n't
push
#main
'
s
white
background
down
.

Can
anyone
suggest
how
to
get
the
#main
to
recognise
the
size
it
's
supposed
to
strech
down
to
?

Should
I
approach
this
differently
?

Thanks

Actually
,
they
ARE
behaving
correctly
and
parent
divs
are
never
to
expand
to
contain
floated
elements
.

As

When
you
use
server
side
rendering
,
you
cannot
close
the
"
chain
"
you
are
refering
to
as
easily
.

This
is
because
what
Django
does
in
this
case
is
serve
all
the
HTML
and
JS
(
at
leas
the
JS
inside
your
HTML
view
)
in
a
single
initial
response
.

The
ajax
requests
you
do
after
that
will
not
be
bound
to
the
variables
you
send
initially
in
your
response
because
this
variables
are
populated
when
the
render()
function
is
called
.

After
that
moment
,
you
cannot
add
or
update
the
variables
that
were
sent
to
the
HTML
template
.

The
only
way
you
can
manage
rendering
small
parts
of
HTML
is
using
JQuery
or
making
your
backend
a
REST
API
with
Django
Rest
Framework
and
moving
to
a
more
complete
frontend
framework
like
Angular
or
React
.

The
are
many
discussions
over
server
side
rendering
vs
client
side
rendering

I
've

a

questions
about

in
C++
.

From
what
I
know
about
them
..
.

An
exception
can
be
thrown
from
within
the
main()
function
.

Any
block
of
code
that
can
throw
an
exception
in
the
main()
function
should
be
surrounded
by
try
and
catch
statements
as
follows

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_4346
(
code
omitted
for

)

In
the
example
above
,
why
is
the
argument
to
the
catch
a
const
char
*
.

Does
n't
C++
allow
for
strings
?

Also
,
is
it
possible
to
throw
an
exception
that
is
n't
a
const
char
*
,
like
an
int
?

or
a
char
?

Does
throwing
an
exception
in
foo
,
terminate
the
foo
function
?

Are
there
cases
where
you
could
put
the
try
and
catch
statements
in
the
same
function
as
the
throw
?

Sorry
if
these
are
basic
questions
.

Thanks

OP_BLOCK

(

Because
you
threw
string
literal
which
decays
to
const
char*
.

In
short
,
you
catch
what
you
throw
.

OP_BLOCK
:
(
output
omitted
for
annotation
)

It
does
,
but
to
catch
string
,
you
need
to
throw
string
in
first
place
.

OP_BLOCK
:
(
output
omitted
for
annotation
)

You
can
throw
literally
anything
.

It
is
a
good
idea
to
throw
special
exception
classes
,
like
std::exception
and
derived
from
it
.

OP_BLOCK
:
(
output
omitted
for
annotation
)

Yes
,
it
does
.

OP_BLOCK
:
(
output
omitted
for
annotation
)

If
you
want
,
you
can
do
that
.

There
are
not
much
cases
where
doing
it
is
a
good
idea
.

It
looks
like
you
need
to
get
a
good
book
and
read
chapter
about
exceptions
.

In
the
meantime
this
super-FAQ
entry
might
help
you/

Answer_to_Question_ID
:
35528780

Question_URL
:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35528780/

You
can
throw
an
object
of
any
type
.

EDIT
:
(
Hopefully
I
got
this
right
now
)

What
you
have
done
is
throw
a
C-string
,
which
is
of
type
const
char[13]
in
this
case
.

C-Arrays
will
decay
to
pointers
to
their
first
element
,
in
this
case
a
pointer
of
type
const
char*
.

Typically
what
you
want
to
do
is
throw
a
predefined
exception
object
.

They
can
be
found
in
header
<stdexcept>
and
are
derived
from
a
base
class
std::exception
.

The
derived
exception
classes
are
for
instance
std::logic_error
,
std::range_error
,
std::bad_alloc
etc
.

Their
constructors
take
a
string
as
argument
,
so
you
can
for
instance

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5063
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
message
can
be
accessed
in
a
catch
statement
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5064
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

If
an
exception
is
caught
,
so-called
stack
unwinding
takes
place
.

You
can
then
deal
with
the
error
locally
,
or
rethrow
the
exception
.

Only
when
an
exception
is
thrown
and
never
caught
,
std::terminate()
is
called
an
the
program
aborted
.

You
can
put
try/catch
statements
anywhere
.

However
,
remember
what
the
term
"
exception
"
actually
means
.

Cases
that
can
easily
dealt
with
using
a
simple
conditional
expression
if
(
n
<
0
)
break
;
or
something
like
that
,
do
n't
need
the
exception
treatment
.

Especially
if
you
can
realistically
expect
this
kind
of
unwanted
condition
to
be
true
often
.

Then
it
is
not
something
"
exceptional
"
.

If
you
decide
to
deal
with
an
error
using
exceptions
and
they
can
not
be
treated
locally
,
you
may
put
try/catch
clauses
around
the
beginning
and
end
of
main()
.

Since
you
can
put
several
catch
statements
directly
after
a
try
statement
,
you
can
then
begin
to
deal
with
more
specific
errors
,
or
simply
catch
anything
via
catch(...)
{
//..
.
}
.

This
is
all
described
in
great
detail
(
including
pointers
on
when
and
when
not
to
use
it
,
in
the
C++
FAQ
.

EDIT
:
Here
's
an
example
that
makes
use
of
try/catch
statements
.

However
,
not
an
exception
object
is
caught
,
but
an
int
(
errno
)
.

Just
to
show
,
that
you
can
really
throw/catch
anything
you
like

If
I
want
to
find
the
root
of
a
warning
I
generally
just
promote
Warnings
to
Exceptions
.

In
your
case
you
could
simply
use
warnings.simplefilter
or
warnings.filterwarnings
.

For
example
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6636
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

which
gives
a
complete
traceback
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6637
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

And
if
you
want
to
debug
this
you
could
easily
hook
Pythons
pdbs
on
the
last
encountered
exception
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6638
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

resulting
in
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6639
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
starts
a
post-mortem
analysis
of
the
last
encountered
exception
.

Which
should
enable
you
to
dig
through
the
frames
and
inspect
the
variables
,
etc
.

You
also
asked
about
a
flag
,
and
indeed
there
is
a
flag
that
enables
"
warning
handling
"
,
the
-W
flag
.

It
's
very
much
like
the
warnings.filterwarnings
function
.

For
convenience
I
just
copied
the
documentation
of
the
-W
flag
here

You

e.g

Here
is
my
scenario
..
.

I
am
using
pagination
with
DataTables
.

My
first
column
is
css
styled
based
upon
data
that
is
passed
in
.

So
,
I
display
the
correct
colored
icon
for
the
property
of
the
item
in
the
table
.

Everything
on
page
1
displays
correctly
.

Just
doing
the
basics
,
everything
on
further
pages
does
not
get
displayed
because
it
is
removed
from
the
DOM
at
that
time
.

So
,
I
did
$('#my_id')
.on
(
'page
.dt
'
,
function()
{
perPageFunctionCall()
;})
.dataTable(soonansoforth)
}
;
to
call
a
function
which
selects
the
correct
colored
flag
.

When
I
click
on
page
2
,
nothing
gets
updated
.

I
click
on
page
1
again
and
it
redisplays
the
1st
page
correctly
.

I
click
on
page
2
a
second
time
now
and
it
displays
everything
correctly
this
time
.

So
what
is
causing
the
display
not
to
update
with
my
new
css
the
1st
trip
but
to
display
properly
on
subsequent
trips
?

Is
there
someway
to
refresh
the
element
or
the
data
table
after
I
am
done
with
my
css
manipulation
?

:

I

running
a

.

They

do
something
every

no
matter
if
the

The

is
,
after

10
hours
)
this
process
becomes
weird
timed
.

Sometimes
it
takes
10
seconds
,
sometimes
4
hours
etc
.

Now
,
I
've

that
you
can
use
a
Partial
Wake
Lock
to
solve
this
issue
.

Tried
it
,
but
it
has
not
solved
my

(
Maybe
you

know
that
another

is
also
using
a
WakeLock
which
gets

after
some

but
mine

Maybe
you
should
also
know
that
the

runs
on
an
asynctask
(
so
on
it
's

thread
)
.

The
wakelock
is
created
from
outside
.

Edit
:

Maybe
it
's
good
to
know
that
it
's
a
device
owner
app
.

Also
,
I
know
of
the
battery
drain
problem

but
I
still
need
it

The
app
really
has
to
process
this
every
second

I
just
need
a
solution

it

any
,
no
matter
which

I
am
having
a

stop
connection

What
I
want
is
,
When

Connection

I

it

much
time

my
Client

gets
into
unresponsive
state
and
comes
back
after
around
28-30
secs
.

Is
there
any
way
to
disconnect
client
immediately
once
the
button
is
clicked
?

This
is
because
of
a
deadlock
.

SignalR
client
blocks
the
thread
when
sending
the
Abort
request
.

However
Silverlight
wants
to
send
the
request
on
the
UI
thread
.

The
default
timeout
for
stopping
the
connection
is
30
seconds
so
after
the
timeout
the
thread
is
unblocked
and
execution
continues
.

This
can
be
worked
around
by
invoking
stop
asynchronously
(
await
Task.Factory.StartNew
(()
=>
hubConnection.Stop());)
or
making
the
timeout
smaller
.

Your
use
of
clearTimeout()
here
is
wrong
.

You
need
to
pass
it
a
reference
to
the
ID
returned
when
you
created
that

with

.

Ca
n't

The
reason
your
gsub
does
n't
work
is
because
.
has
a
special
meaning
in
regex
.

You
can
have
it
interpreted
literally
by
specifying
fixed
=
TRUE
.

Answer_to_Question_ID
:
16840884

Question_URL
:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16840884/

in
your
gsub
call
,
"
.
"
is
your
pattern
.

The
"
.
"
symbol
in
a
pattern
means
"
any
character
"
,
so
you
're
talling
gsub
to
replace
every
character
with
a
dash
.

The
correct
gsub
call
requires
escaping
the
period
so
R
knows
this
is
a
literal
period
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2193
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
syntax
will
have
gsub
replace
all
periods
with
dashes
.

But
really
,
this
is
n't
what
you
want
,
you
want
dates
.

You
need
to
use
as.Date
like
so
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2194
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Your
intended
solution
would
only
have
converted
your
strings
to
a
different
string
format
.

Using
as.Date
tells
R
to
treat
the
values
as
dates
and
not
strings
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2195
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

will
produce
an
error
(
because
R
does
n't
understand
what
you
want
when
you
ask
it
to
plot
nothing
but
strings
)
,
whereas
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2196
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Produces
a
plot
of
index
vs
.
day
of

From
my
experience
,
if
you
hit
Shopify
with
multiple
cart
changes
at
the
same
time
,
only
one
will
go
through
.

My
guess
is
that
Shopify
handles
the
cart
something
like
this
:

At
time
0
we
have
our
initial
cart
-
call
it
cart0

At
time
t
,
we
submit
n
simultaneous
requests
to
add/update/change
the
cart

Request
0
:
take
cart0
and
apply
request
,
return
result

Request
1
:
take
cart0
and
apply
request
,
return
result

..
.

Request
n
:
take
cart0
and
apply
request
,
return
result

seems

return
values

each
callback
function
would
trigger
with
a
cart
that
had
a
single
change
applied
.

I
've
found
two
ways
to
deal
with
this
limitation
.

The
first
is
to
make
sure
the
requests
are
chained
so
that
we
wait
for
one
to
finish
before
making
the
next
-
effectively
turning
the
asynchronous
requests
into
synchronous
ones
.

Not
the
best
for
speed
.

The
other
method
only
works
if
we
do
n't
have
line
item
properties
to
worry
about
:
combining
all
the
additions/changes
into
one
call
to
/cart/update.js
,
passing
the
variant
IDs
and
desired
quantities
all
at
once
-
see
https://help.shopify.com/themes/development/getting-started/using-ajax-api#update-cart
for
examples
.

If
you
do
n't
have
line
properties
to
worry
about
,
changing
your
single-line
additions
into
one
big
update
will
be
a
significant
speed
and
reliability
increase
.

I
have
a
javafx
application
with
a
TableView
.

Only
the
first
column
(
dataTypeColumn
)
is
editable
and
it
contains
a
ComboBox
for
editing
.

Now
the
TableView
does
what
it
is
supposed
to
do
,
however
there
is
a
combination
of
weird
bugs
when
i
start
editing
a
cell
and
then
scroll
it
out
of
view
without
commiting
the
edit
.

I
am
pretty
sure
it
is
because
of
the
way
TableView
reuses
the
cells
.

However
I
have
n't
found
any
way
to
intervene
with
it
,
for
example
to
forbid
reuse
of
cells
that
are
currently
editing
.

Can
you
help
me
with
that
.

Even
though
I
am
pretty
sure
it
is
because
of
cell
reuse
,
I
will
write
the
whole
problem
below
,
in
case
the
source
of
the
problem
is
a
different
.

The
column
in
question
contains
Values
of
the
enum
DataType

I
have
a
cell
Factory
for
that
column
looking
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_5121
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
values
for
the
column
get
read
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_5122
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

In
case
this
is
confusing
,
the
items
that
I
give
my
TableView
are
Integers
(
from
0
to
n-1
)
,
and
in
the
different
column
CellValueFactories
the
actual
values
will
be
loaded
depending
on
the
Integer
assoziated
with
the
current
column
.

So
when
editing
it
,
it
shows
a
ComboBox
with
all
the
Values
that
DataType
can
have
and
let
's
the
user
select
one
.

I
have
a
callback
on
the
column
that
reacts
to
the
Edit
commited
event
and
looks
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_5123
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

So
about
the
problems
that
occur
.

At
the
beginning
all
cells
in
that
column
have
the
same
value
:
"
nothing
selected
"
.

It
is
a
special
value
of
the
enum
reserved
for
this
case
,
as
I
did
n't
find
a
setPlaceholder
function
on
the
ComboBoxTableCell
class
.

When
I
know
start
editing
one
of
the
cells
and
then
scroll
it
out
of
view
,
one
of
the
next
rows
will
suddendly
be
in
the
editing
state
as
well
,
even
though
that
row
has
not
been
touched
before
.

If
I
scroll
further
an
cell
in
the
editing
state
will
appear
every
time
the
previous
one
scrolls
out
of
view
.

I
can
also
go
back
and
will
find
the
same
cells
in
the
editing
state
.

If
I
edit
the
cell
that
should
not
be
in
the
editing
state
,
it
will
not
change
,
but
instead
the
cell
that
I
originally
tried
to
edit
will
change
it
's
value
.

This
might
be
due
to
the
underlying
ObservableList
,
that
automatically
updates
the
value
in
the
column
.

If
I
start
editing
a
cell
that
has
a
different
value
(
from
a
previous
edit
)
,
something
even
more
weird
happens
.

When
scrolling
it
out
of
view
again
a
new
row
will
have
a
cell
in
the
editing
page
,
however
with
the
default
value
"
nothing
selected
"
.

If
I
scroll
backwards
the
cell
that
i
tried
to
edit
originally
will
no
longer
be
in
the
editing
state
however
it
's
value
has
changed
to
"
nothing
selected
"
.

As
if
the
new
cell
that
got
the
editing
state
somehow
commited
it
's
own
value
.

Please
some
help
with
this
:)

This
indeed
seems
to
be
a
bug
.

Rather
surprising
,
if
you
move
the
scroll
bar
with
the
mouse
,
the
edit
is
properly
canceled
,
but
not
,
if
you
use
the
mouse
wheel
to
scroll
.

You
can
easily
create
a
workaround
for
this
buf
however
,
since
you
simply
have
to
cancel
the
edit
,
when
the
item
is
replaced
.

You

e.g
.

use

This
happens
when
one
of
the
objects
you
're
linking
into
an
executable
changes
significantly
.

For
example
it
gains
or
loses
some
lines
of
profilable
code
.

The
minimal
case
to
produce
the
error
is
with
2
source
files
.

Here
are
2
example
source
files
called
c
..
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_260
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

and
stuff.c

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_261
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

What
they
do
is
n't
important
.

To
build
them
,
here
is
a
simple
Makefile
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_262
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
Makefile
is
set
up
so
that
the
compilation
is
main.c
->
main.o
,
stuff.c
->
stuff.o
and
finally
stuff.o
+
main.o
->
testexe
.

If
we
compile
and
link
those
C
files
with
the
-fprofile-arcs
-ftest-coverage
options
then
the
executable
file
has
profiling
.

Run
that
execuatable
and
you
'll
get
2
output
files
,
main.gcda
and
stuff.gcda
.

So
far
so
good
.

Now
change
the
line
#if
0
to
#if
1
.

The
Makefile
should
cause
just
stuff.c
to
recompile
,
and
the
executable
to
relink
.

Next
time
you
the
test
executable
gets
run
you
'll
get
the
"
Merge
mismatch
"
message
for
the
main.gcda
file
.

The
stuff.gcda
file
is
not
affected
since
its
object
file
has
been
recreated
with
all
the
new
summary
information
.

If
you
recompile
main.c
and
relink
the
executable
,
then
the
error
message
goes
away
.

So
what
can
be
done
?

I
'd
love
to
know
!

At
the
moment
I
run
find
.
-name
'
*
.gcda
'
|
xargs
rm
whenever
I
need
to
re-check
coverage
,
which
is
not
really
ideal
.

Another
solution
would
be
to
recompile
everything
when
using
profiling
"
just
in
case
"
,
but
that
seems
like
overkill
.

The

to
run
fetch
on
all

the
cursors
and
concatenate
them
into
a
single
array
.

CODE_BLOCK

Because

The
way
you
can
do
it
is
by
adding
position
:
absolute
to
the
container
's
style
,
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3429
(
code
omitted

This
will
make
both
errors
have
the
same
position
while
fading
,
and
thus
overlapping
(
which
is
what
I
think
you
mean
by
crossfading
)

I
also
had
to
change
the
width
of
the
container
because
its
width
was
making
the
error

span
several
lines
.

Almost

Gather

The

problem
I
can
see
with
the
code
supplied
is
that
you
do
n't
pass
the

your

It
should
read
something
like
this
:

Also
your

as

That
regex
is
not
legal
in
sed
;
since
it
uses
Perl
syntax
,
my
recommendation
would
be
to
use
perl
instead
.

The
regular
expression
works
exactly
as-is
,
and
even
the
command
line
is
almost
the
same
;
you
just
need
to
add
the
-p
option
to
get
perl
to
operate
in
filter
mode
(
which
sed
does
by
default
)
.

I
would
also
recommend
adding
an
argument
suffix
to
the
-i
option
(
whether
using
sed
or
perl
)
,
so
that
you
have
a
backup
of
the
original
file
in
case
something
goes
horribly
wrong

for

to

you

this

you

Programming

I
just
read

on
the
three
data
loading
types
:

Lazy
loading
(

)

Eager
loading

Explicit
loading

Now
I
'm
asking

which
data
loading
is
better
in

situation

A

comparison

!

I

any
.

For
example
,
I
'm
using
default
lazy
loading
on
a
module
for
a
client
.

This
module
deals
with
sales
reps
and
imply
these
related
tables
:

Reps

Reps_Zones

Reps_Prerequisites

Users

Reps_Languages

etc
.

On

I
use
all
these
tables
to
dispatch
appointments
(
about
150
appointments
to
50
reps
at
a
time
)
,
but
it
's

Answer_to_Question_ID

Question_URL

Lazy-loading
seems
most
suitable
for
smaller
apps
without
separate
data
layers
.

Once
the
app
grows
and
you
start
separating
it
into
separate
layers
,
lazy
loading
becomes
less
useful
.

The
DBcontext
has
long
since
been
destroyed
by
the
time
the
data
gets
to
the
UI
layer
,
and
while
you
are
within
the
datalayer
it
is
not
a
big
deal
to
specify
the
properites
to
load
.

Lazy
loading
is
turned
off
for
validation
,
so
if
a
property
is
marked
as
required
and
you
have
only
loaded
the
parent
an
error
will
always
be
thrown
which
is
very
frustrating
.

Lazy
loading
also
makes
debugging
rather
tricky
as
the
query
isnt
executed
until
it
is
used
so
you
ca
n't
examine
the
results
of
the
query
as
easily
.

I
usually
add
a
ToList()
or
similar
to
my
EF
queries
so
I
can
easily
examine
the
results
.

Of
course
,
but
that
's
not
the
way
you
do
things
with
XAML
.

You
could
set
a
Tag
property
on
your
ListBoxItem
to
anything
,
but
the
common
approach
is
to
use
the
MVVM
pattern
and
bindings
where
you
would
set
ItemsSource
of
your
ListBox
to
a
collection
of
items
and
each
of
your
items
would
have
properties
to
display
and
other
properties
to
use
elsewhere
.

You
would
bind
the
visible
properties
to
the
elements
in
the
ItemTemplate
of
your
ListBox
and
bind
SelectedItem
of
the
ListBox
with
a
TwoWay
binding
to
a
property
of
your
view
model
.

Now
if
you
do
n't
care
about
patterns
and
simply
want
to
see
it
working
-
go
ahead
and
use
the
Tag
and
the
SelectionChanged
event
.

Optional
has
an
==
operator
defined
for
it
in
the
Swift
standard
library
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3825
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

That
means
if
the
optional
contains
a
value
that
's
equatable
,
you
can
compare
two
optionals
.

If
the
two
optionals
are
both
nil
they
're
equal
,
and
if
the
two
optionals
wrap
values
that
are
equal
,
then
they
're
equal
.

So
if
you
do
n't
care
about
whether
person.name
is
nil
or
not
,
just
whether
it
contains
a
value
of
"
John
"
,
you
can
just
write
if
person.name
==
"
John
"
.

How
does
that
work
,
when
"
John
"
is
a
String
not
a
String
?
?

*
Because
Swift
will
implicitly
convert
any
type
to
an
optional
wrapping
that
type
if
that
's
what
an
argument
requires
.

So
because
the
==
function
for
comparing
optionals
requires
a
String
?
argument
,
"
John
"
will
be
implicitly
converted
to
{
Some
"
John
"
}
,
allowing
the
==
operator
between
two
optionals
to
be
used
.

*
well
actually
"
John
"
is
n't
a
String
either
,
it
's
a
string
literal
that
is
getting
converted
into
a
String

I
created
a
Service
Object
called
Transaction
which
processes
an
order
made
,
sets
up
the
payments
and
then
sets
up
a
model
association
.

The
class
is
called
Transaction
with
two
methods
,
initialize
and
pay
.

I
am
testing
it
in
spec/services/
(
it
is
in
app/services
)
.

The
initialize
method
takes
in
an
account
and
some
parameters
passed
in
by
the
user
to
process
the
order
.

I
am
trying
to
test
pay
with
rspec
.

How
do
I
actually
do
such
a
test
?

This
function
has
a
lot
going
on
.

For
example
,
it
creates
new
models
,
and
then
sets
up
some
associations
between
them
.

So
far
,
I
created
a
double
account
as
follows
:

@account
=
double
(
"
account
"
,
:confirmed
=>
true
,
:confirmed
?
=>
true
)

However
,
there
are
many
functions
(
and
associations
)
used
in
the
Transaction
pay
method
.

So
for
example
when
these
associations
are
called
(
once
I
call
Transaction.pay
in
the
test
)
,
it
returns
an
error
:

CODE_BLOCK

The
business
model
is
a
double
just
like
account
,
and

to
@account
.

How
can
I
test
my
Transaction.pay
when
it
creates
new
models
and
associations
in
there
?

Do
I
need
to
mock
all
of
them
as
shown
above
?

Or
is
there
a
better
way
to
do
it
?

I
am
using
FactoryGirl
,
but
I
am
unable

use
it

my

cannot
be
used

since
I
'm

,
it
wo
n't

It
's
hard
to
be
specific
,
since
you
've
not
provided
your
Transaction
class
code
,
but
at
a
high
level
,
here
's
what
I
'd
recommend
:

Do
not
use
FactoryGirl
or
Devise
helpers
-
ideally
,
you
're
writing
a
unit
test
for
this
class
,
so
you
do
n't
want
any
external
dependencies
.

Stub
out
any
model
instances
you
're
dealing
with
-
which
is
what
you
've
done
with
account
.

Stub
out
any
external
classes
being
used
within
the
service
(
such
as
Business
)
,
and
if
you
're
creating
instances
of
those
from
the
classes
,
then
they
're
doubles
too
.

Here
's
a
vague
example
with
no
real
implementation
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_2289
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

You
'll
note
I
've
only
required
the
transaction
file
-
this
helps
you
be
aware
of
what
other
classes
it
depends
on
,
because
you
'll
(
ideally
)
stub
the
constants
,
or
if
necessary
,
require
other
files
.

It
'll
keep
this
spec
's
running
time
much
better
too
.

Also
,
I
only
stubbed
confirmed
?
,
not
confirmed
on
the
account
double
.

From
a
Rails
perspective
they
mean
the
same
thing
,
but
it
's
better
to
use
one
of
them
consistently
,
instead
of
both
.

If
you
have
a
ton
of
setup
(
a
lot
of
constants
and
test
doubles
)
,
then
I
'd
take
that
as
a
sign
that
this
Transaction
class
probably
needs
to
be
broken
up
into
several
more
specific
classes
.

In
my
app
I
want
to
use
$
this->forward404
(
"
Data
not
found
"
)
;
to
output
individual
error
messages
when
necessary
.

In
the
dev
mode
it
works
fine
.

When
I
run
my
app
in
production
mode
-
where
debug
is
set
to
false
in
getApplicationConfiguration()
-
I
do
n't
get
the
messages
anymore
.

in
settings.yml
I
set
a
custom
404
action
.

all
:
.actions
:
error_404_module
:
main
error_404_action
:
custom404

How
can
I
pass
the
forward404
to
my
custom404Success.php
template
??
?

The
404
handling
is
completely
different
between
prod
and
dev
.

In
prod
,
the
message
you
pass
to
the
forward404
is
simply
written
to
the
log
and
not
passed
to
the
handler
action
.

There
are
many
ways
to
get
round
this
,
but
the
quickest
(
albeit
dirtiest
)
would
be
to
store
the
message
in
a
static
variable
somewhere
so
the
404
handler
can
access
it
once
the
process
gets
there
,
e.g
.

In
your
action
,

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_410
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

And
in
your
404
handler
(
assuming
it
's
in
CommonActions
)
,

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_411
(
code
omitted
for
annotation

If

get
code
of
method
you
can
see
that
method
throws
an
sfError404Exception
,
that

respect

.

In
dev
it
simple
throws
an

and
in
prod
it
might
be
handle
via
set_exception_handler("my_handle")
.

There
is
no
difference
between
example
1
and
2
.

Both
rethrows
the
original
exception
,
and
both
catches
the
general
Exception
.

You
would
use
example
1
if
you
wanted
to
catch
a
more
specific
exception
,
such
as
DivisionByZeroException
.

For
the
last
example
,
you
are
not
re-throwing
the
exception
;
but
throwing
the
same
exception
object
that
you
caught
.

This
causes
the
exception
stacktrace
to
be
re-set
to
the
location
where
you
throw
it
-
which
might
be
a
problem
because
the
stacktrace
then
does
not
point
to
the
location
in
code
,
where
the
error
actually
occured
.

This
is
general
Azure
Functions
behavior
.

The
reason
GET
does
n't
work
is
because
the
function
in
the
sample
is
only
configured
to
work
with
POST
.

See
the
[
HttpTrigger
]
attribute
in
the
function
signature
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6792
(
code
omitted

If
you
want
to
support
GET
,
then
change
the
methods
parameter
accordingly
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_6793
(

Note
that
Visual
Studio
seems
to
have
a
caching
bug
where
making
changes
to
route
information
is
not
properly
saved
when
debugging

.

I
opened
a
GitHub
issue
to
track
that
here
:

For
more
information
on
HTTP

see
this
documentation

If
you
want
to
trigger
a
Durable

using
a
timer
trigger
,
then
just
change
the
trigger
type
.

I

There
are
many
optimization
problems
that
are
known
to
be
NP-hard
,
such
as
the
traveling
salesman
problem
,
MAX-SAT
,
or
finding
the
minimum
chromatic
number
of
a

.

Given
a
problem
of
this

,
I
'm
curious
about
the
complexity
of
the
following
problem
:

Intuitively
,
it
seems
like
this
might
be
co-NP
hard
,
since
it
's
easy
to
refute
an
answer
to
an

problem
by
guessing
a
better
solution
and
using
it
as
a
witness
,
but
I
have
no
idea
how
to
show
this
.

In
fact
,
I
do
n't
really
know
how
to
reason
about
the
complexity
of
this
problem
.

Does
anyone
know
of
any
good
lower
bounds
on
the
complexity
of
this
decision
problem
?

Knowing
whether
this
was
co-NP
hard
,
PSPACE-hard
,
etc
.
would
be
really
interesting
.

The
term
'
NP-hard
optimization
problem
'
seems
a
bit
too
broad
to
let
a
satisfying
answer
be
found
.

For
instance
,
I
ca
n't
see
what
precludes
decision
problems
from
being
considered
NP-hard
optimization
problems
-
if
you
consider
,
say
,
the
MAX-CNF-SAT
problem
with
the
solutions
being
scored
as
floor(k/N)
,
where
k
is
the
number
of
satisfied
clauses
and
N
is
the
total
number
of
clauses
in
the
instance
(
which
is
clearly
computable
in
polynomial
time
)
,
then
any
valuation
which
yields
a
1
in
this
formula
will
have
to
satisfy
the
whole
formula
.

So
let
's
assume
that
we
are
maximizing
floor(k/N)
and
call
this
the
FLOOR-CNF-SAT
optimization
problem
:
)

This
implies
you
can
reduce
TAUTOLOGY
to
said
optimization
problem
-
negate
the
input
and
add
any
solution
as
S
.
You
can
even
add
a
dummy
variable
to
make
sure
the
initial
solution
is
gets
a
0
in
the
FLOOR-CNF-SAT
problem
.

Negation
is
polynomial
in
time
.

Then
if
a
solver
for
the
proposed
problem
deems
S
to
not
be
optimal
,
there
must
clearly
be
a
valuation
which
yields
a
1
according
to
our
crafted
function
and
thus
satisfies
the
whole
formula
-
in
turn
providing
a
valuation
that
does
not
satisfy
the
original
input
to
TAUTOLOGY
.

By
cheating
slightly
(
using
an
artificially
crafted
optimization
problem
)
we
have
established
the
'
is
optimal
'
problem
as
co-NP-complete
,
since
TAUTOLOGY
is
easily
shown
to
be
co-NP-complete
.

By
your
own
argument
the
'
is
optimal
'
decision
problem
is
co-NP-hard
,
since
as
a
witness
you
only
need
a
better
solution
-
score
S
,
score
the
witness
and
compare
.

I
do
n't
really
feel
great
about
this
reduction
but
I
ca
n't
easily
improve
on
the
problem
class
.

If
you
require
that
there
be
instances
which
score
arbitrarily
high
and
not
just
{
0
,
1}
,
I
could
just
use
N
*
floor(k/N)
.

An
improvement
to
the
class
could
be
to
only
consider
a
problem
an
NP-hard
optimization
problem
if
for
each
K
there
exists
an
instance
that
has
at
least
K
solutions
which
all
score
differently
.

I
think
I
can
still
cheat
my
way
through
that
:

Consider
a
reduction
that
adds
N
dummy
variables
to
the
TAUTOLOGY
input
as
follows
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_593
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

where
S
is
the
negated
input
.

As
an
initial
valuation
I
choose
d1
,
..
.
,
dN
=
false
,
but
as
a
score
I
give
a
function
that
returns
2N
-
1
if
the
first
N
clauses
are
all
false
,
otherwise
it
returns
the
number
of
satisfied
clauses
.

Such
a
function
would
only
return
2N
if
all
the
clauses
were
satisfied
but
could
easily
have
at
least
N
distinct
values
.

I
am
afraid
that
without
some
complicated
regularity
conditions
on
the
scoring
function
this
is
the
best
we
can
get
,
unless
you
consider
the
definition
of
an
NP-hard
optimization
problem
to
be
'
a
problem
for
which
,
given
a
candidate
solution
S
,
we
can
in
polynomial
time
verify
whether
S
is
optimal
'
,
in
which
case
'
is-optimal
'
is
clearly
P
and
it
's
no
fun
at
all:/

Here
is
a
DRY
way
of
dismissing
signals
.

If
you
want
to
dismiss
a
signal
to
avoid
recursion
,
a
simple
way
to
go
is
to
set
an
attribute
on
the
current
instance
to
prevent
upcoming
signals
firing
.

This
can
be
done
using
a
simple
decorator
that
checks
if
the
given
instance
has
the
'
skip_signal
'
attribute
,
and
if
so
prevents
the
method
from
being
called
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_3761
(

We
can
now
use
it
this
way
:

You
need
to
increase
the
length
of
your
varchar
field
.

Multibyte
characters
use
more
than
one
character
and
length
in
the
definition
of
varchar
field
are
byte
based
.

So
,
your
special
char
might
be
taking
more
than
a

Approach
#1

There
is
a
built
in
MATLAB
function
pdist2
which
finds
"
Pairwise
distance
between
two
sets
of
observations
"
.

With
it
,
you
can
calculate
the
euclidean
distance
matrix
and
then
find
indices
of
minimum
values
along
the
appropriate
dimension
in
the
distance
matrix
that
would
represent
the
"
closest
"
for
each
row
of
bigList

littleList

The

I
think
it
is
because
the
MFMessageComposeViewController
has
got
a
navigation
bar
.

Your
application
should
be
a
navigation

application
for
that
.

Otherwise
your
toolbar
's
frame
position
will
be
affected
.

I
had
this
kind
of
problem
once
.

So
i
changed
the
application
into
navigation
based
but
hid
the
navigation

.

this

You
can
use
enumerate
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4315
(

omitted
for
annotation
)

Note
that
as
a
more
efficient
way
for
accessing
to
next
items
and
refuse
of
multiple
indexing
you
can
use
iter()
function
to
create
an
iterator
object
from
your
list
(
from
second
element
to
end
)
and
access
to
next
elements
in
each
iteration
with
next
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4316
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Note
that
if
you
do
n't
pass
the
None
as
the
second
argument
to
next()
function
it
will
raise
a
StopIteration
error.You
can
also
handle
it
with
a
try-except
statement
.

Also
for
short
lists
you
can
use
zip
function
and
for
long
lists
itertools.izip()
function
(
zip
in
python
3)
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4317
(

zip(l,l[1:])
will
give
you
the
following
pairs
of
items
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_4318
(
code
omitted

and
in
the
loop
you
can
use
i
as
the
current
item
then
j
will
be
the
next
item
or
use
j

The
problem
is
that
you
are
linking
to
that
styles.css.php
from
inside
the
rendered
html
.

This
means
that
page
will
be
fetched
in
a
separate
request
(
as
you
can
se
when
you
inspect
the
page
)
.

This
request
never
passes
trough
your
index.php
,
and
so
the
$name
variable
will
not
be
set
.

I
would
advise
you
to
include
the
css
in
the
rendered
HTML
inside
a
style
block
.

It
should
be
as
easy
as
changing
your
import.php
to
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5334
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
also
has
the
added
benefit
of
reducing
the
number
of
requests
the
browser
has
to
make
,
and
should
therefore
speed
up
the
page
.

This
is
btw
not
a
very
standard
method
of
using
css
.

I
believe
it
would
be
better
to
add
some
sort
of
id
(
or
data
attribute
)
on
your
body
tag
that
indicates
the
name
of
the
page
you
are
on
.

In
the
css
file
(
that
does
not
run
trough
php
,
just
a
standard
css
file
)
,
you
could
then
do
something
like
this
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_5335

Answer_to_Question_ID

The

tag
makes
an

request
for
a

totally
independent
of
the

that
are
including
each
other
,
so
$name
is
not
available

To
do
it
this
way
you
need
to
link
the

something

this
to
pass

If
all
you
need
to
do
is
read
and
write
it
then
std::string
is
fine
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_576
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

This
works
because
no
multi-character
UTF
codepoint
overlaps
with
an
an
ASCII
character
so
the
standard
processing
of
text
works
just
fine
in
relation
to
end
of
line
sequence
and
there
is
no
other
processing
done
by
the
stream
.

What
you
read
is
what
you
get
.

Outputting
the
string
does
not
change
any
of
the
codepoints
.

Now
if
you
need
to
manipulate
the
text
that
is
a
different
question
and
gets
more
complex
.

Usually
manipulating
UTF-8
is
way
to
hard
(
can
be
done
but
not
worth
it
IMO
)
.

When
it
comes
to
manipulating
the
text
you
want
to
convert
the
UTF-8
(
which
is
not
a
fixed
width
)
to
an
internal
fixed
width
format
;
(
UTF-16
or
UTF-32
are
common
formats
for
manipulation
and
easy
to
use
;
(
UTF-16
windows
,
UTF-32
for
most
*
nix
like
OS
)
)
.

The
easiest
way
to
do
this
is
to
imbue
the
stream
with
a
facet
that
knows
the
input
is
in
UTF-8
and
will
convert
it
automatically
.

There
are
a
couple
of
these
facets
floating
around
in
different
libraries
.

But
an
easy
one
to
find
is
boost
:

http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_38_0/libs/serialization/doc/codecvt.html

Note
:
It
is
also
in
the
latest
version
of
boost
1.46

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_577
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

The
processes
is
the
same
for
writting
UTF-16/32
back
to
a
stream
and
converting
it
to
UTF-8

CODE_BLOCK
:
A_578
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Note
.

You
should
imbue
the
file
before
it
is
opened
.

Different
implementations
of
the
stream
will
react
differently
if
you
imbue
the
stream
after
it
is
open
.

Thus
it
is
best
to
imbue
the
stream
before
opening
it
.

Dinkumware
also
has
a
set
of
conversion
facets
(
not
sure
if
they
are
free
)
.

http://www.dinkumware.com/manuals/default.aspx?manual=compleat&page=index_cvt.html#Code%20Conversions

Note
:
I
prefer
to
use
the
terms
UTF-X
rather
than
UCS-Y
.

Though
technically
there
are
very
minor
differences
these
are
inconsequential
compared
to
the
confusion
you
can
create
by
switching
between
the
two
terms
while
talking
about
the
subject
.

Stick
to
one
unless
you
need
to
talk
explicitly
about
a
feature
(
like
Surrogate
pairs
)
.

The

has
no
side
effects
since
you
're
not
using
B
anywhere
,
so
any
decent
compiler
with

will
eliminate
it
.

To
avoid
that
,
you
could
try
to
summarize
the
values

Alternatively
,
printing

enough
to
avoid

I

a
problem

I

around
5
hours
trying
everything
,
but
I
was
not
even
able
to
reproduce
it
properly
so
I
include
the
simplified
original
source
code
.

I
apologize
for
the
extent
,
but
I
wanted
to
include
all
the
relevant
information
I
found
out
so
far
.

This
is
one
of
the
few
times
I
feel
completely
powerless
and
kindly
request
your
help
.

Any
ideas
are
welcome
.

Also
any
comments
that
can
bring
at
least
some
light
to
the
matter
.

The
behaviour
in
this
case
is
a
complete
mystery
to
me
.

I
am
programming
in
QtCreator
in
Ubuntu
.

I
am
trying
to
develop
a
framework
to
solve
mathematical
problems
using
a
Population
of
candidate
solutions
,
which
should
evolve
into
the
true
solution
.

There
are
3
classes
involved
:
Population
,
PopulationMember
and
Problem
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_752
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Usually
my
program
runs
in
loops
,
where
the
population
calls
its
various
methods
.

One
of
them
is
Population::evaluate()
.

My
program
ran
great
until
I
introduced
some
new
methods
of
Population
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_753
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

Then
I
get
a
segmentation
error
in
the
middle
of
program
.

The
strangest
thing
is
that
it
happens
only
after
the
10
loops
,
after
the
population
executed
report()
.

Also
after
some
experimentation
,
when
I
excluded
all
the
operations
which
require
dynamic
allocation
of
some
sort
(
strings
)
from
the
report()
method
,
I
do
not
get
the
error
.

Conversely
when
I
disable
the
sorting
method
(
uses
either
std::sort
or
qSort
)
the
problem
stops
.

Also
when
I
leave
the
actions
done
by
the
temp
Population
,
there
is
no
problem
.

So
I
started
to
debug
the
program
.

I
let
it
complete
10
loops
and
started
to
debug
step
by
step
.

I
went
into
Population->evaluate()
;

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_754
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

}

debug
:

The
addres
printed
out
is
0xbffff628
.

This
is
same
as
the
previous
10
*
population_->members_.count()
printouts
.

I
go
inside
the
(
*
it
)
->
evaluate()
;
Here
I
switch
to
assembly
code
:

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_755
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

I
go
inside
the
call
of
function
at
the
last
instruction
.

At
the
instant
I
do
this
,
all
the
attributes
in
problem_
become
not
accessible
according
to
my
debugger
.

At
this
point
all
is
lost
.

CODE_BLOCK
:
Q_756
(
code
omitted
for
annotation
)

debug
:

Finally
the
address
the
problem_
is
pointing
at
becomes
0xbffff780
instead
of
0xbffff628
.

An
increment
of
344

This
happens
always
.

The
increment
is
344
.

If
I
make
some
minor
changes
in
the
program
,
the
address
changes
,
but
the
difference
between
these
two
addresses
remains
344
.

This
is
all
the
more
puzzling
,
since
the
size
of
all
my
three
classes
is
less
than
100
.

The
program
crashes
inside
the
void
Problem
::
evaluate(PopulationMember&)const
;
method
as
soon
as
some
logic
is
involved
.
